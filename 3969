## Idea

The notion of smooth $(\infty,1)$-algebra is the analog in [[higher category theory]] of [[smooth algebra]]. This is the basis for the [[derived geometry]] version of [[differential geometry]]/[[synthetic differential geometry]].

## Definition

A **smooth $\infty$-algebra** is an [[âˆž-algebra over an (âˆž,1)-algebraic theory]] $T$ for $T$ the ordinary [[Lawvere theory]] of [[smooth algebra]]s.


## Applications

Smooth $(\infty,1)$-algebras appear as the algebras of functions in the theory 
of [[derived smooth manifold]]s.
