## Idea

The notion of smooth $(\infty,1)$-algebra is the analog in [[higher category theory]] of [[smooth algebra]].

## Definition

A [[smooth algebra]] is an algebra over [[CartSp]] regarded as a [[Lawvere theory]]. 

Accordingly, a smooth $(\infty,1)$-algebra is an algebra over [[CartSp]] regarded as an [[(âˆž,1)-algebraic theory]]: a product-preserving [[(âˆž,1)-functor]] $CartSp \to $ [[âˆžGrpd]].

The [[(âˆž,1)-category]] of smooth $(\infty,1)$-algebras is accordingly the full [[sub-(âˆž,1)-category]]

$$
  (\infty,1)Func_\times(CartSp, \infty Grpd) \subset
  Func(CartSp, \infty Grpd)
$$

on product-preserving $(\infty,1)$-functors of the [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-functors]] from [[CartSp]] to [[âˆžGrpd]].

As described at [[(âˆž,1)-algebraic theory]], this may be [[presentable (âˆž,1)-category|presented]] by for instance a [[model category]] structure on [[simplicial object]]s in the category of [[smooth algebra]]s, or by a model structure on simplicial co-presheaves.

## Applications

Smooth $(\infty,1)$-algebras appear as the algebras of functions in the theory 
of [[derived smooth manifold]]s.
