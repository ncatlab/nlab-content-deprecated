## Cofinal functotrs

A [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **cofinal** if for every [[object]] $d \in D$ the [[comma category]] $(d/F)$ is [[connected category|connected]].


## Generalizations

The generalization of the notion of cofinal functor from [[category theory]] to [[(âˆž,1)-category|(âˆž,1)]]-[[higher category theory]] is described at

* [[cofinal (âˆž,1)-functor]].
