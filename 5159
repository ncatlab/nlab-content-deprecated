## Definition

The [[cohomology]] of an [[object]] $X$ in an [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ with coefficients in another object $A$ is the set of connected components of the [[hom-space]] from $X$ to $A$.

Notice that for every [[(âˆž,1)-sheaf (âˆž,1)-topos]] there is the terminal [[global section]] [[(âˆž,1)-geometric morphism]]


$$
 (LConst \dashv \Gamma) : \mathbf{H} 
  \stackrel{\overset{LConst}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}
 \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

In the case that $A = LConst \mathcal{A}$ for $\mathcal{A} \in $ [[âˆžGrpd]]  we say that 

$$
  H(X,\mathcal{A}) := \pi_0 \mathbf{H}(X, LConst \mathcal{A})
  \,.
$$

the **cohomology of $X$ with constant coefficients**, constant on $\mathcal{A}$

###### Remark


For $\mathbf{H}$ the [[(âˆž,1)-sheaf (âˆž,1)-topos]] over an [[(âˆž,1)-site]] $C$, we have that $LConst \mathcal{A}$ is the [[constant âˆž-stack]] over $C$. Notice that this is the [[âˆž-stackification]] of the [[(âˆž,1)-presheaf]] that is literally constant (as an [[(âˆž,1)-functor]]) on $\mathcal{A}$. So unless over $C$ constant presheaves already satisfy [[descent]] (as for instance over an [[(âˆž,1)-cohesive site]]) the object $LConst \mathcal{A}$ is not itself given by a constant functor on $C^{op}$.

## Properties

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Observation

If $\mathbf{H}$ is a [[locally âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]] in that we have a further [[left adjoint|left]] [[adjoint (âˆž,1)-functor]] $\Pi$ to $LConst$

$$
  (\Pi \dashv LConst \dashv \Gamma) : \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd
$$

then by the [[adjunction]] hom-equivalence $\mathbf{H}(X, LConst \mathcal{A}) \simeq \infty Grpd(\Pi(X), \mathcal{A})$ we have that cohomology with constant coefficients in $\mathbf{H}$ is equivalently the cohomology of the [[fundamental âˆž-groupoid in a locally âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]] $\Pi(X)$ in [[âˆžGrpd]] with coefficients in $\mathcal{A}$.

A [[cocycle]] 

$$
  (\tilde \nabla : X \to LConst \mathcal{A}) \sim (\nabla : \Pi(X) \to \mathcal{A})
$$

in this cohomology may then be identified with what is called a [[local system]] on $X$ with coefficients in $\mathcal{A}$. So in this case we have

## Examples

The relation between cohomology with local coefficients cohomology in [[âˆžGrpd]] $\simeq$ [[Top]] is discussed at [[nonabelian cohomology]] in the section <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nonabelian+cohomology#NonabelianSheafCohomology">nonabelian sheaf cohomology</a>.
