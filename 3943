## Idea

The analog in [[(âˆž,1)-category]] theory of the/a [[adjoint functor theorem]] in ordinary [[category theory]].

## Statement


+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

Let $F = C \to D$ be an [[(âˆž,1)-functor]] between [[locally presentable (âˆž,1)-categories]] then

1. it has a right [[adjoint (âˆž,1)-functor]] precisely if it preserves small [[limit in a quasi-category|colimits]];

1. it has a left [[adjoint (âˆž,1)-functor]] precisely if it is an [[accessible (âˆž,1)-functor]] and preserves small [[limit in a quasi-category|limits]].
