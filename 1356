a "simplicial weak $\omega$-category" can be used to mean two different things:

* a [[simplicial object]] in some category of weak [[omega-category|Ï‰-categories]];

* a [[simplicial model for weak Ï‰-categories]].

However, when you run into the term in the literature, chances are high that what is meant is the second sense. See there for references.
