## Idea

A _connection_ on a $G$-[[principal âˆž-bundle]] in the [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H} =$ [[âˆžLieGrpd]] is a structure that serves to interpolate between the [[nonabelian cohomology]] class $c \in H(X, \mathbf{B}G)$ of tbe bundle and its intrinsic [[curvature characteristic form|curvature characteristic class]]es in de Rham cohomology $H_{dR}^{n+1}(X)$ or even in [[ordinary differential cohomology]] $H_{diff}(X,\mathbf{B}^n U(1))$. This is the content of the [[âˆž-Chern-Weil homomorphism]].

This generalizes the notion of [[connection on a bundle]] and the ordinary [[Chern-Weil homomorphism]].


## Details

> this entry is currently a placeholder for the discussion that is being developed at [[âˆž-Chern-Weil theory]] in the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/infinity-Chern-Weil+theory#InfinityLieAlgebraConnection">section on âˆž-connections</a>

An ordinary [[connection on a bundle]] (as discussed there) over a [[Lie group]] $G$ is given by  [[cocycle]] in the [[Lie groupoid]] $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ whose $U$-parameterized smooth family of objects and morphisms is the [[groupoid of Lie-algebra valued 1-forms]] on $U$.

Accordingly, for $\mathfrak{g}$ an [[âˆž-Lie algebra]] there is an [[âˆž-Lie groupoid]] $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ whose $U$-families are the [âˆž-groupoid of âˆž-Lie algebra valued forms]] on $U$. An $\infty$-connection is a [[cocycle]] with coefficients in this object.
