 A Tall-Wraith monoid is to a variety of algebras (in the sense of general algebra) as a biring is to a ring (from Tall and Wraithâ€™s original paper) or as a plethory is to an algebra (from the Borger and Wieland paper).  Technically, itâ€™s a monoid in the category of (take a deep breath) co-ð’±-objects in the variety of ð’±-algebras (it not being too hard to show that this has a monoidal structure).
