## Idea

Monodromy is the name for the [[action]] of the the [[homotopy group (of an âˆž-stack)|homotopy groups]] of a [[space]] $X$ on fibers of [[covering space]]s or [[locally constant âˆž-stack]]s on $X$.

## Details

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be an [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] and $X \in \mathbf{H}$ an object. At least in nice situations the [[locally constant âˆž-stack]]s on $X$, represented by morphisms $X \to LConst Core(\infty Grpd)$ are equivalently encoded by the [[adjunct]] morphism $\Pi(X) \to \infty Grpd$ out of the bare [[schreiber:path âˆž-groupoid]]. This morphism exhibits the **monodromy** of the [[locally constant âˆž-stack]]. 

Specifically, the restriction $\mathbf{B}\Omega_x \Pi(X) \hookrightarrow \Pi(X) \to \infty Grpd$ to the [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}\Omega_x \Pi(X)$ of the [[loop space object]] $\Omega_x \Pi(X)$ at a chosen baspoint $x : {*} \to X$ is the **monodromy [[action]]** of loops based at $x \in X$ on the fiber of the locally constant $\infty$-stack over $x$.
