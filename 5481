## Idea

A [[site]] is **$\infty$-local** if it satisfies sufficient conditions for the [[(âˆž,1)-sheaf (âˆž,1)-topos]] over it to be a [[local (âˆž,1)-topos]].



## Definition

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

A [[site]] $C$ is **$\infty$-local** if 

* it has a [[terminal object]];

* the [[limit]]-functor $\lim_\leftarrow : [C^{op}, sSet] \to$ [[sSet]]
  sends [[Cech nerve]] projections $C(U) \to X$ over [[covering]] families
  $\{U_i \to X\}$ to [[weak homotopy equivalence]]s:

  $$
    Hom_C(*, C(U)) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Hom_C(*,X)
    \,.
  $$

###### Remark

If $C$ is also a [[strongly âˆž-connected site]] then it is an [[âˆž-cohesive site]].

## Proposition

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

For $C$ an $\infty$-local site, the [[(âˆž,1)-sheaf (âˆž,1)-topos]] $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ over it is a [[local (âˆž,1)-topos]].

The proof is currently at [[âˆž-cohesive site]]. To me moved here.
