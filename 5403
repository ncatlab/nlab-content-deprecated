## Definition

A **JÃ³nsson-Tarski algebra**, also called a _Cantor algebra_, is a [[set]] $A$ together with an [[isomorphism]] $A\cong A\times A$.

## Properties

* Clearly (at least in [[classical mathematics]]), any JÃ³nsson-Tarski algebra is either [[empty set|empty]], a [[singleton]], or [[infinite set|infinite]].

* The structure of a JÃ³nsson-Tarski algebra can be described by an [[algebraic theory]], with one binary operation $\mu$ and two unary operations $\lambda$ and $\rho$ such that $\mu(\lambda(x),\rho(x)) = x$, $\lambda(\mu(x,y))=x$, and $\rho(\mu(x,y))=y$.

* The category of JÃ³nsson-Tarski algebras is a [[topos]], although this is not in general the case for algebraic theories.  See [here](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/nice/).
