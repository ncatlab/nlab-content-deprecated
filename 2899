This entry is about Ã©tale morphisms in the sense of [[algebraic geometry]]. The word [[etale map|Ã©tale map]] is preffered in context of [[topology]] and [[differential geometry]], see [[Ã©talÃ© space]] for the topological version.

## Definition


A [[morphism]] of [[schemes]] is **Ã©tale** if 

* it is a [[smooth morphism of schemes|smooth morphism]] 

* and it is of [[relative dimension]] $0$. 

Equivalently, it is [[flat morphism|flat]] and [[unramified]].  

(A number of other equivalent definitions are listed at [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etale_morphism).)  

There is a weaker notion of a formally Ã©tale morphism. A morphism is **formally Ã©tale** if it is [[formally smooth]] (satisfying an infinitesimal lifting property) and formally unramified. These are sheaf-like properties, what can be formalized in the language of [[Q-categories]] ([[monopresheaf]] and [[epipresheaf]] properties on the $Q$-category of nilpotent thickenings). 


## Properties

The property of being Ã©tale is [[base change|preserved under pullbacks]] along any morphism of schemes; a [[composite]] of Ã©tale maps is Ã©tale.

A smooth map of schemes is Ã©tale iff there is an Ã©tale cover of the base  scheme by [[open subschemes]] such that the pullback of the projection to each of them is an open local isomorphism of [[locally ringed spaces]] (and in particular, the pullback of the projection morphism is an [[Ã©talÃ© space|Ã©tale map]] of the corresponding underlying topological spaces). This disjointness picture of Ã©tale covers make them suitable for having nontrivial [[cohomology]] in situations where Zariski covers give vanishing cohomology.


## The Ã©tale sites

Ã‰tale morphisms are used to define small and big [[etale site|Ã©tale sites]] and [[Ã©tale cohomology]]. Ã‰tale topology has similar cohomological properties to complex [[analytic topology]], and in particular it is much finer for cohomological purposes than the [[Zariski topology]].
