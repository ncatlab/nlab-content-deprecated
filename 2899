This entry is about Ã©tale morphisms in the sense of [[algebraic geometry]]. The word [[etale map|Ã©tale map]] is preffered in differentiable and topological contexts, see [[Ã©talÃ© space]] for the topological version. 

Recall that for a [[smooth morphism of schemes]] $f:X\to Y$ we can define a relative dimension in every point $X$. 
A morphism of [[schemes]] is **Ã©tale** if it is a smooth morphism and if it is of relative dimension $0$. Equivalently, it is [[flat morphism|flat]] and unramified. 
The property of being Ã©tale is [[base change|preserved under pullbacks]] along any morphism of schemes; a [[composite]] of Ã©tale maps is Ã©tale.

There is a weaker notion of a formally Ã©tale morphism. A morphism is **formally Ã©tale** if it is [[formally smooth]] (satisfying an infinitesimal lifting property) and formally unramified. These are sheaf-like properties, what can be formalized in the language of [[Q-categories]] ([[monopresheaf]] and [[epipresheaf]] properties on the $Q$-category of nilpotent thickenings). 

Ã‰tale morphisms are used to define small and big [[etale site|Ã©tale sites]] and [[Ã©tale cohomology]]. Ã‰tale topology has similar cohomological properties to complex [[analytic topology]], and in particular it is much finer for cohomological purposes than the [[Zariski topology]]. 

A smooth map of schemes is Ã©tale iff there is an Ã©tale cover of the base  scheme by [[open subschemes]] such that the pullback of the projection to each of them is an open local isomorphism of locally ringed spaces (and in particular, the pullback of the projection morphism is an [[Ã©tale morphism|Ã©tale map]] of the corresponding underlying topological spaces). This disjointness picture of Ã©tale covers make them suitable for having nontrivial cohomology in situations where Zariski covers give vanishing cohomology.
