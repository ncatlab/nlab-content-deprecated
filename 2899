## Idea

The notion of _Ã©tale morphism of schemes_ is the realization of the general notion of [[Ã©tale morphism]] for maps between [[schemes]], hence it captures roughly the idea of a map of schemes which is a [[local homeomorphism]]/[[local diffeomorphism]].

A central use of Ã©tale morphisms of schemes is that they appear as [[coverings]] in the [[Grothendieck topology]] of the [[Ã©tale site]]. The [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with respect to these Ã©tale covers of schemes is accordingly called _[[Ã©tale cohomology]]_.



## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #EquivalentConditionsForEtale}
###### Definition

A [[morphism]] of [[schemes]] is an **Ã©tale morphism** if the following equivalent conditions hold:

1. it is

   1. [[smooth morphism of schemes|smooth]] 

   1. [[unramified morphism|unramified]] 

1. it is

   1. [[smooth morphism of schemes|smooth]] 

   1. of [[relative dimension]] $0$. 

1. it is 

   1. [[flat morphism|flat]] 

   1. [[unramified]];

1. it is

   1. [[formally Ã©tale morphism of schemes|formally Ã©tale]];

   1. [[locally of finite presentation]]

=---

(A number of other equivalent definitions are listed at [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etale_morphism).)  

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

For morphisms $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ between [[algebraic varieties]] over an [[algebraically closed field]] this means that for all points $p \in X$ the induced morphism on [[tangent cones]]

$$
  T_p X \longrightarrow T_{f(p)} Y
$$

is an [[isomorphism]]. This is analogous to the corresponding characterization of [[local diffeomorphisms]] of [[smooth manifolds]].

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Relaxing the finiteness condition in item 4 of \ref{EquivalentConditionsForEtale} yields the notion of _[[weakly Ã©tale morphism]]_.

[[Ã©tale morphism of schemes|Ã©tale morphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[pro-Ã©tale morphism of schemes|pro-Ã©tale morphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[weakly Ã©tale morphism of schemes|weakly Ã©tale morphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[formally Ã©tale morphism of schemes|formally Ã©tale morphism]]

###### Definition

A jointly surjective collection of Ã©tale morphisms $\{U_i \to X\}$ is called an [[Ã©tale cover]].

=--


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Most of the pairs of conditions in def. \ref{EquivalentConditionsForEtale} can be read as constraining the fiber of the morphism to be first suitably surjective/[[bundle]]-like ([[smooth morphism of schemes|smooth]], [[flat morphism|flat]]) and second suitably locally injective ([[unramified]]).

Specifically the first condition has an [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal anlog]]: a [[formally Ã©tale morphism]] is a [[formally smooth morphism|formally smooth]] and [[formally unramified morphism]]. These notions also have an interpretation in [[synthetic differential geometry]] and there they correspond to the statement that a [[local diffeomorphism]] is a [[submersion]] which is also an [[immersion of smooth manifolds]].

###### Definition

A morphism is **[[formally Ã©tale morphism]]** if it is 

* [[formally smooth]] (satisfying an infinitesimal lifting property) 

* and [[formally unramified]]. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

These are sheaf-like properties, which can be formalized in the language of [[Q-categories]] ([[monopresheaf]] and [[epipresheaf]] properties on the $Q$-category of nilpotent thickenings). 

See at _[[differential cohesion]]_ and at _[[infinitesimal shape modality]]_.

## Properties


### Closure properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

* A [[composite]] of two Ã©tale morphism is itself Ã©tale.

* The [[pullback]] of an Ã©tale morphism is Ã©tale.

* If $f_1 \circ f_2$ is Ã©tale and $f_1$ is, then so is $f_2$.

(e.g. [Milne, prop. 2.11](#Milne))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Use that an Ã©tale morphism is a [[formally Ã©tale morphism]] with finite fibers, and that $f \colon X \to Y$ is formally Ã©tale precisely if the [[infinitesimal shape modality]] [[unit of a monad|unit]] [[natural transformation|naturality square]]

$$
  \array{
    X &\longrightarrow& \Pi_{inf}(X)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    Y &\longrightarrow& \Pi_{inf}(Y)
  }
$$

is a [[pullback]] square. Then the three properties to be shown are equivalently the [[pasting law]] for pullback diagrams.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition


A [[smooth morphism of schemes]] is Ã©tale iff there is an [[Ã©tale cover]] of the base  scheme by [[open subschemes]] such that the pullback of the projection to each of them is an open local isomorphism of [[locally ringed spaces]] (and in particular, the pullback of the projection morphism is an [[Ã©talÃ© space|Ã©tale map]] of the corresponding underlying topological spaces). 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This disjointness picture of Ã©tale covers make them suitable for having nontrivial [[cohomology]] in situations where Zariski covers give vanishing cohomology.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $k$ be a [[field]]. A morphism of [[scheme]]s $Y \to Spec k$ is Ã©tale precisely if $Y$ is a [[coproduct]] $Y \simeq \coprod_i Spec k_i$ for each $k_i$ a finite and separable [[field extension]] of $k$.

This appears for instance as [de Jong, prop. 3.1 i)](#deJong). 

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Such Ã©tale morphisms are classified by the classical [[Galois theory]] of field extensions.

###### Proposition

A [[ring]] homomorphism of [[affine varieties]] $Spec(A) \to Spec(B)$ for $Spec(B)$ non-singular and for $A \simeq B[x_1, \cdots, x_n]/(f_1, \cdots, f_n)$  with [[polynomials]] $f_i$ is Ã©tale precisel if the [[Jacobian]] $det(\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j})$ is invertible.

=--

This appears for instance as ([Milne, prop. 2.1](#Milne)).




### As locally constant sheaves {#AsLocallyConstantSheaves}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

A [[sheaf]] $F$ on a scheme $X$ corresponds to an Ã©tale morphism $Y \to X$ precisely if there is an [[Ã©tale cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$ such that each restriction

$$
  F|_{U_i} \simeq LConst K_i
$$

is [[isomorphic]] to a [[constant sheaf]] on a [[set]] $K_i$.

=--

A proof is in ([Deligne](#Deligne)).



## Examples

* A finite separable [[field extension]] $K \hookrightarrow L$ corresponds dually to an Ã©tale morphism $Spec L \to Spec K$. These are the morphisms classified by classical [[Galois theory]].
