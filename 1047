Following the terminology of [[(n,r)-category|(n,r)-categories]], an __$(\infty,0)$-category__ is an [[âˆž-category]] in which every $j$-morphism (for $j \gt 0$) is invertible.  This is one way to define an _[[âˆž-groupoid]]_.

This is directly analogous to how a [[0-category]] is equivalent to a [[set]], a [[(1,0)-category]] is equivalent to a [[groupoid]], and so on.  (In general, an [[(n,0)-category]] is equivalent to an [[n-groupoid]].)
