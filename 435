## Definition ##

A _simplicially enriched category_ is a [[enriched category|category enriched over]] the [[cartesian monoidal category]] [[sSet]] of [[simplicial sets]].

These enriched categories are sometimes, somewhat imprecisely, called just _[[simplicial categories]]_.


There is a related notion of [[simplicial groupoid]] with the added requirement that all arrows in the categories concerned are [[isomorphisms]].

## As models for $(\infty,1)$-categories 

Since simplicial sets that are [[Kan complex]]es are an incarnation of [[âˆž-groupoid]]s, an $sSet$-category all whose [[hom-object]]s happen to be [[Kan complex]]es may be regarded as a category enriched in [[âˆž-groupoid]]s. By the logic of [[(n,r)-category]] theory this should be a model for an [[(âˆž,1)-category]].

Treating simplicial categories tis way as models for $(\infty,1)$-categories is one of the central tools in [[homotopy coherent category theory]].

Indeed, there is a [[model structure on simplicial categories]] whose fibrant objects are Kan-complex enriched categories, and which is one model for the [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-categories]].

By a web of [[Quillen equivalence]]s this is related to the other incarnations of $(\infty,1)$-categories. Notably to [[quasi-categories]] and [[complete Segal space]]s. For more on this see
