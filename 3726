## Idea

An **$n$-connected object** is an object all whose [[homotopy group]]s _below_ degree $n$ are trivial.

More precisely, and object in an [[âˆž-stack]] [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] is $n$-truncated if its [[homotopy groups in an (âˆž,1)-topos|categorical homotopy groups]] below degree $n$ are trivial.

The complementary notion is that of an [[n-truncated object of an (âˆž,1)-category]].

The [[Whitehead tower]] construction produces $n$-connected objects.

## Examples

### In $Top$

In the the [[(âˆž,1)-category]] [[Top]] we have

* a 1-connected object is a [[connected space]].

* a 2-connected object is a [[simply connected space]].
