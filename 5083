## Definition

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

For $\mathbf{H}$ an [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] we say its **co-shape** $\Gamma \mathbf{H}$  is the object

$$
  \Gamma(\mathbf{H}) : A
  \mapsto
  (\infty,1)Topos((\infty,1)PSh(A), \mathbf{H})
  \in
  (\infty,1)\hat Sh(\infty Grpd)
$$

in the [[huge (âˆž,1)-sheaf (âˆž,1)-topos]] on [[âˆžGrpd]].

+-- {: .un_remar}
###### Remark

For $\mathcal{U}$ the bigger [[universe]] and $\kappa$ a [[regular cardinal]] such that [[small set]]s are $\kappa$-smal, we have that 

$$
  (\infty,1)\hat Sh(\infty Grpd) \simeq \hat Ind_\kappa(\infty Grpd)
$$

is identified with the $\kappa$-[[ind-object in an (âˆž,1)-category|ind-objects]] of [[âˆžGrpd]].

## Properties

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Coshape [[Yoneda extension|Yoneda-extends]] to a pair of [[adjoint (âˆž,1)-functor]]s between the [[huge (âˆž,1)-sheaf (âˆž,1)-topos]]es

$$
  (\infty,1)\hat Sh(\infty Grpd)
  \stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{Codisc}{\to}}
  \infty \hat Sh((\infty,1)Topos)
$$

on [[âˆžGrpd]] and [[(âˆž,1)Topos]], respectively.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, lemma 6.3.5.21]] we have an [[(âˆž,1)-functor]] 

$$
  (\infty,1)\hat Sh((\infty,1)Topos)
  \to 
  (\infty,1)\hat Sh(\infty Grpd)
$$

that preserves $\mathcal{U}$-small colimits and finite limits and is given by sending

$$
  F : (\infty,1)Topos^{op} \to \infty Grpd
$$

to the composite

$$
   \infty Grpd
   \stackrel{PSh(-)}{\to}
   (\infty Topos/\infty Grpd)_{et}^{op}
   \stackrel{}{\to}
   (\infty,1)Topos^{op}
   \stackrel{F}{\to}
   \infty Grpd
  \,,
$$

where the first step is forming [[(âˆž,1)-presheaf (âˆž,1)-topos]]es which sit by their terminal [[global section]] [[(âˆž,1)-geometric morphism]] over [[âˆžGrpd]] and the second step is the evident projection.

Applied to a [[representable functor|representable]] 
$F = (\infty,1)Topos(-,\mathbf{H})$ this composite is hence 

$$
  A \mapsto \Gamma(\mathbf{H})(A)
  \,.
$$
