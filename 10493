###### Definition

An [[(âˆž,1)-functor]] $F \colon \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}$ out of an [[(âˆž,1)-category]] with [[finite (âˆž,1)-colimits]] is **$n$-excisive** (or polynomial of degree at most $n$) if whenever $X$ is a strongly cocartesian $(n + 1)$-cube in $\mathcal{C}$, $F(X)$ is a cartesian cube in $\mathcal{D}$. (This is comparable to how a polynomial of degree at most $n$ is determined by its values on $n + 1$ distinct points.)
 

A 1-excisive (âˆž,1)-functor is called [[excisive (âˆž,1)-functor|excisive]].
