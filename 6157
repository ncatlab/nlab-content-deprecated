## Idea

The notion of an _$(\infty,1)$-vector bundle_ is a [[categorification]] of the notion of a [[vector bundle]], where [[field]]s and [[ring]]s are replaced by [[âˆž-ring]]s.

Recall that for $k$ a [[field]], a [[vector space]] is a $k$-[[module]], and a [[vector bundle]] over a [[space]] $X$ is classified by a morphism 
$\alpha : X \to k$[[Mod]] with $k$[[Mod]] regarded as an object in the relevant [[topos]]. For instance for _discrete_ or _flat_ vector bundles $k Mod$ is the [[category]] [[Vect]] of vector spaces.
There is the subcategory $k Line \hookrightarrow k Mod$ of 1-[[dimension]]al $k$-vector bundles, and morphisms that factor as $\alpha : X \to k Line \hookrightarrow k Mod$ are $k$-[[line bundle]]s.
In the discrete case the vector space of [[section]]s of the vector bundle classified by $\alpha$ is the [[colimit]] $\lim_\to \alpha$.

These statements [[categorification|categorify]] in a straightforward manner to the case where $k$ is generalized to a commutative [[âˆž-ring]]: an _[[E-âˆž ring]]_ or _[[ring spectrum]]_ . Modules are replaced by [[module spectrum|module spectra]] and colimits by [[homotopy colimit]]s.

The resulting notion of $(\infty,1)$-vector bundles plays a central role in many constructions in [[orientation in generalized cohomology]], [[twisted cohomology]] and [[Thom isomorphism]]s.

Further generalization of the concept leads to [[(âˆž,n)-vector bundle]]s: an $(\infty,n)$-module over an [[E-âˆž-ring]] $K$ is essentially an object of the [[(âˆž,n)-category]] $(\cdots (K Mod) Mod ) \cdots Mod$.

## Definition

### Discrete $(\infty,1)$-vector bundles

Throughout we denote by $K$ an [[E-âˆž ring]] and by $A$ a $K$-algebra, hence an [[A-âˆž algebra]] in [[Spec]] equipped with a $\infty$-algebra homomorphism $K \to A$.

Write $A Mod$ for the [[(âˆž,1)-category]] of $A$-[[module spectrum|module spectra]].

###### Definition

For $X$ a [[discrete âˆž-groupoid]] (often presented as a [[topological space]]), the [[(âˆž,1)-category]] of **$A$-module $\infty$-bundles** over $X$ is the [[(âˆž,1)-functor (âˆž,1)-category]]

$$
  A Mod(X) := Func(X, A Mod)
  \,.
$$

In this form this appears as ([ABG def. 3.7](#ABG)). Compare this to the analogous definition at [[principal âˆž-bundle]].

###### Remark

If $X$ is regarded as a [[topological space]] then the corresponding [[discrete âˆž-groupoid]] is $\Pi X$, the [[fundamental âˆž-groupoid]] of $X$ and the morphism encoding an $K$-module bundle over $X$ is reads

$$
  \alpha : \Pi(X) \to A Mod
  \,.
$$

This assignment of $A$-modules to points in $X$, of $A$-module morphism to paths in $X$ etc. may be regarded as the [[higher parallel transport]] of the (unique and flat, due to [[discrete âˆž-groupoid|discreteness]]) [[connection on an âˆž-bundle]] on $\alpha$. 

Equivalently, this morphism may be regarded as an [[âˆž-representation]] of $\Pi(X)$. Notaby if $X = B G$ is the [[classifying space]] of a [[discrete group]] or [[discrete âˆž-group]], a $K$-module $\infty$-bundle over $X$ is the same as an [[âˆž-representation]] of $G$ on $A Mod$.

###### Definition

Write 

$$
  A Line \hookrightarrow A Mod
$$

for the [[full sub-(âˆž,1)-category]] on the _$A$-line_ : on those $A$-modules that are equivalent to $A$ as an $A$-module. The full subcatgeory of $A Mod(X)$ on morphisms factoring through this inclusion we call the $(\infty,1)$-catgeory of **$A$-line $\infty$-bundles**.

This appears as ([ABG def. 3.12](#ABG)).
