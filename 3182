## Idea 

A _[[Top|topological]] [[âˆž-groupoid]]_ is an [[internal âˆž-groupoid]] in [[Top]]. As described there, a general interpretation of what that means is to say that this is an [[âˆž-stack]] on [[Top]].

## Homotopy invariance and topological spaces

A central result about [[âˆž-stack]]s on [[Top]] is that the sub-[[(âˆž,1)-topos]] of homotopy invariant objects is equivalent to [[Top]] itself. A nice discussion of this is in

* Dan Dugger, _Sheaves and homotopy theory_ ([web](http://www.uoregon.edu/~ddugger/cech.html), [dvi](http://www.uoregon.edu/~ddugger/cech.dvi), [pdf](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/cech.pdf))

In fact, this is true even for [[Lie âˆž-groupoid]]s, i.e. [[âˆž-stack]]s on [[Diff]]: the homotopy invariant ones model plain [[topological space]]s.

This provides a useful resolutions of topological spaces that often helps to disentangle the twoo different roles played by a topological space: on the one hand as a model for an [[âˆž-groupoid]], in the other as a [[locale]]:
