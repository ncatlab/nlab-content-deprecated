## Idea 

A _topological $\infty$-groupoid_ is an [[âˆž-groupoid]] equipped with [[topology]].


## Definition

Let $TopBalls$ be the site of [[open ball]]s with the [[good open cover]] [[coverage]].

###### Definition

Define

$$
  \infty TopGrpd := (\infty,1)Sh(TopBalls)
$$

to be the [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-sheaves]] on $TopBalls$.

###### Lemma

###### Proof

The site $TopBalls$ clearly satisfies the properties of a  [[(âˆž,1)-cohesive site]].

###### Definition

A **topological $\infty$-groupoid** is a [[concrete (âˆž,1)-sheaf]] on $TopBalls$. The [[(âˆž,1)-quasitopos]] of topological $\infty$-groupoids is

$$
  \infty Grpd
   \hookrightarrow
   Concr(\infty TopGrpd)
  \stackrel{\overset{concretization}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  \infty TopGrpd
  \,.
$$

## Properties

### Homotopy invariance and topological spaces

The sub-[[(âˆž,1)-category]] [[âˆž-stack]]s on [[Top]] (even on [[Diff]]) that are homotopy invariant is equivalent to plain [[âˆžGrpd]]. 

**Idea**

A central result about the [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(Top)$ of [[âˆž-stack]]s on [[Top]] is that the [[homotopy localization]] is equivalent to [[Top]] itself

$$
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(Top)^I \simeq Top
  \,.
$$

A discussion of this is in (the nice but not quite finished) ([Dugger](#Dugger)).

In fact, this is true even for [[Lie âˆž-groupoid]]s, i.e. [[âˆž-stack]]s on [[Diff]]: the homotopy invariant ones model plain [[topological space]]s.

This provides a useful resolution of [[topological space]]s that often helps to disentangle the two different roles played by a topological space: on the one hand as a model for an [[âˆž-groupoid]], in the other as a [[locale]].

**Details**

Let $SPSh(Diff)^{loc}$ be the local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] obtained by left [[Bousfield localization of model categories|Bousfield localization]] at the [[Cech nerve]]s of 
[[Cech cover]]s with respect to the standard [[Grothendieck topology]] on [[Diff]]. This is a [[models for âˆž-stack (âˆž,1)-toposes|model for âˆž-stacks]] on [[Diff]].

Let $SPSh(Diff)^{loc}_I$ be furthermore the left [[Bousfield localization of model categories|Bousfield localization]]
at the set of projection morphisms out of [[product]]s of the form $X \times \mathbb{R} \to X$ for all $X \in Diff$. The $\infty$-stacks that are [[local object]]s with respect
to these morphisms are the _homotopy invariant_ $\infty$-stacks, so this localization models the [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] of homotopy invariant
$\infty$-stacks on $Diff$.

There is a [[adjunction]]

$$
  L : SSet \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} SPSh(Diff) : R
$$

where $L$ sends a simplicial set to the simplicial presheaf constant on that simplicial
set, and where evaluates a simplicial presheaf on the manifold that is the [[point]]. 

**Theorem (Dugger)**

This adjunction $(L \dashv R)$ is a [[Quillen equivalence]] with respect to the  standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]] on the left and the above model structure $SPSh(Diff)_{loc}^I$ on the right.
