**$\infty Grpd$** is the [[(âˆž,1)-category]] of [[âˆž-groupoid]]s, i.e. of [[(âˆž,0)-categories]].

It is the full subcategory of [[(âˆž,1)Cat]] on those [[(âˆž,1)-categories]] that are [[âˆž-groupoid]]s.

It is also the archetypical [[(âˆž,1)-topos]].

## Incarnations

### As an $sSet$-category

As an [[simplicially enriched category]] $\infty Grpd$ is the full [[SSet]]-[[enriched category|enriched subcategory]] of [[SSet]] on [[Kan complex]]es.

### As an enriched model category

$\infty Grpd$ is the [[(âˆž,1)-category]] that is [[presentable (âˆž,1)-category|presented]] by the Quillen [[model structure on simplicial sets]].

As a [[simplicially enriched category|Kan-complex enriched category]] this is the full [[sSet]]-[[subcategory]] on fibrant-cofibrant objects of the Quillen [[model structure on simplicial sets]].

Under the [[homotopy hypothesis]]-theorem, this means that $\infty Grpd$ is also the full $(\infty,1)$-subcategory of [[Top]] on spaces of the [[homotopy type]] of a [[CW-complex]].

## Properties

* As an [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] $\infty Grpd$ is the [[terminal object|terminal]] $(\infty,1)$-topos: for every other [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-sheaves|(âˆž,1)-sheaf]] [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ there is up to a [[contractible]] space of  choices a unique [[geometric morphism]] $(LConst \dashv \Gamma) : \mathbf{H}\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} \infty Grpd$ -- the [[global section]] geometric morphism. See there for more details.

## Subcategories

The [[n-truncated object of an (infinity,1)-category|n-truncated objects]] of $\infty Grpd$ are the [[n-groupoid]]s. (including [[(-1)-groupoid]]s and the [[(-2)-groupoid]]).
