## Idea

The [[higher geometry]] in the [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] over the [[(âˆž,1)-site]] of [[Isbell duality|formal duals]] of [[E-âˆž rings]], equipped with an [[etale topology]], might be called _$E_\infty$-geometry_.

This is the "full" version of [[derived algebraic geometry]] (as opposed to less refined versions where instead of genuine [[E-âˆž rings]] one uses just [[simplicial rings]] and/or just [[dg-algebras]]).

In ([[Spectral Schemes|Lurie, Spectral Schemes]]) this is called "[[spectral geometry]]", but see the possible terminology clash discussed there.

An [[E-âˆž scheme]] in this sense is a [[structured (âˆž,1)-topos]] in $E_\infty$geometry.
