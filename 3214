The notion of **$sSet$-site** is the incarnation of the notion of [[(âˆž,1)-site]] when [[(âˆž,1)-categories]] are incarnated as [[simplicially enriched categories]].

An [[(âˆž,1)-site]] -- an [[(âˆž,1)-category]] equipped with the structure of a [[site]] on its [[homotopy category of an (âˆž,1)-category|homotopy category]] -- serves as a domain for [[âˆž-stack]]s/[[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-sheaves]]. It may be modeled by a [[simplicially enriched category]].

A [[simplicially enriched category]] with the structure of a [[site]] is called an **$SSet$-site** ([def 3.1.1](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0207/0207028v4.pdf#page=18) in [ToVeI](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0404373)).
