## Idea

A *strongly $\infty$-connected site* is a [[site]] satisfying sufficient conditions to make the [[(âˆž,1)-sheaf (âˆž,1)-topos]] over it a [[strongly âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]].


## Definition

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition


Let $C$ be a locally and globally [[âˆž-connected site]]; we say it is a **strongly $\infty$-connected site** if it is also a [[cosifted (âˆž,1)-category]].

=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

If $C$ is in addition an [[âˆž-local site]] then it is an [[âˆž-cohesive site]].

## Properties


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

If $C$ is a strongly $\infty$-connected site, then the [[(âˆž,1)-sheaf (âˆž,1)-topos]] $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ over it is a [[strongly âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to check that the [[fundamental âˆž-groupoid in a locally âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]]-functor $\Pi : Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C) \to \infty Grpd$ preserves finite [[(âˆž,1)-product]]s.

By the discussion at [[âˆž-connected site]] we have that $\Pi$ is given by the [[(âˆž,1)-colimit]] [[(âˆž,1)-functor]] $\lim_\to : Func(C^{op}, \infty Grpd) \to \infty Grpd$. On the [[opposite (âˆž,1)-category|opposite]] and therefore [[sifted (âˆž,1)-category]] $C^{op}$ these preserve finite [[(âˆž,1)-product]]s.
