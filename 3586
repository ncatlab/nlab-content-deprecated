## Idea
 {#Idea}

In the original sense, _microlocal analysis_ (e.g. [Strohmaier 09](#Strohmaier09)) is the study of the [[functional analysis]] of [[generalized functions]]/[[distributions]] with attention paid not just to their [[singular support]], i.e. to the points around which they are singular as generalized functions, but also the directions of [[propagation of singularities theorem|propagation of their singularities]] at each singular point, which is the set of [[covectors]] known as their [[wave front set]]. This extra directional (â€œmicrolocalâ€) information governs the basic operations on distributions, notably the [[pullback of distributions]] and the [[product of distributions]].

Since the wave front set is the set of (co-)directions along which, locally, the [[Fourier transform of distributions]] is not rapidly decreasing (the set of â€œUV divergenciesâ€ in applications to [[perturbative quantum field theory]]), much of microlocal analysis is concerned with constructions related to Fourier transformation, such as the discussion of [[pseudodifferential operators]].

Microlocal analysis in this sense was introduced by ([Sato 70](#Sato70)),  soon  followed  by  ([HÃ¶rmander 71](#Hoermander71), [HÃ¶rmander 83](#Hoermander83)) who  both  introduced the notion of [[wave front set]].
This microlocal point of  view was then extended to [[sheaf  theory]]  by
[Kashiwara-Schapira 82](#KashiwaraSchapira82), [Kashiwara-Schapira 82](#KashiwaraSchapira85)) who  introduced  the  notion  of _[[microsupport]]_  of  sheaves giving rise to _[[microlocal sheaf theory]]_ (see [Schapira 17](#Schapira17)). Beware that some authors still use the term "microlocal analysis" for this sheaf theoretic concept.


## Overview

To accommodate an intuitive notion of a "function of differential operators" there is a simple trick used: consider the [[Fourier transform]]. Then the [[differential operators]] become polynomials. This correspondence of operators and their [[symbol of a differential operator|symbols]] may, with some analytic care, be extended to define generalizations of differential operators by suitably extending a notion of symbols. Thus the [[pseudodifferential operator]]s of Kohn and Nirenberg appeared in 1965 with soon following  revolution in harmonic analysis and analysis in [[PDE]]. This includes a  further generalization, the Fourier integral operators of [[Lars HÃ¶rmander]] and V. Maslov. A part of harmonic analysis involving geometric aspects in the cotangent bundles of such methods is called **microlocal analysis**. The geometric aspects include the support, wavefront set, characteristics...of distributions, pseudodifferential operators and their symbols. There are more technical definitions (involving [[wavefront set]]s, supports and filtrations on the algebras of symbols) of various "microlocal" properties of symbols: [[microlocalization]], microhypoellipticity, microparametrix etc.). In addition to the analytic microlocalization there is a formal microlocalization; and a version of filtered localization theory in noncommutative algebra, so called [[algebraic microlocalization]], which is however not used in operator theory. While local aspect of a differential operator is about its behaviour around a point in coordinate space, the microlocal aspect is about a point in the cotangent bundle, hence it also localizes around the fixed covector direction, hence "micro". 

This is clearly related to the general study of oscillating integrals, including the stationary phase method and WKB-method (and generalizations) in particular. These kind of approximations and related estimates are of importance to the study of the propagation of singularities of differential equations, wave fronts, eikonal equations, and so on.

As oscillating integrals are involved in the analysis of various [[Green functions]] like the [[heat kernel]] there is also a connection to [[index theorems]] for [[elliptic differential operators]], see [HÃ¶rmander 83](#Hoermander83).

## Relevance for QFT

When considering [[AQFT on curved spacetimes]] and [[locally covariant perturbative quantum field theory]] one has to replace the axioms involving the representation of the [[Poincare group]], since that is a speciality of the Minkowski spacetime. A general curved spacetime will not have any symmetries. In particular the axiom of the spectrum condition has to be replaced, which can be done by a condition on the [[wavefront set]] on two point functions of a state.
