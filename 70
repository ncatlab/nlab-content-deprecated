The term _$\omega$-category_ is used more or less synonymous with _[[âˆž-category]]_ , though the two terms appear with different frequency in different parts of the literature.

Originally, $\omega$-categories were introduced as

* [[strict Ï‰-categories]].

The general concept is that of

* [[weak Ï‰-categories]].
