## Idea

The analog in [[(âˆž,1)-category]] theory of the notion of a [[site]] in ordinary [[category theory]].

## Definition

A quick but  someehat deceptive definition is:

an $(\infty,1)$-site is a [[(âˆž,1)-category]] equipped with the structure of an ordinary [[site]] on its [[homotopy category of an (âˆž,1)-category]].

An equivalent but more natural definition is 
...(see references below for the moment)...

## Properties

**Proposition** Structures of $(\infty,1)$-sites on an [[(âˆž,1)-category]] $C$ correspond bijectively to [[topological localization]]s of the [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-presheaves]] to a [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-sheaves]]. See there for more details.

## Incarnations and models

If [[(âˆž,1)-categories]] are incarnated as [[simplicially enriched categories]], then an $(infty,1)$-site appears as an 

* [[sSet-site]]

If $(\infty,1)$-categories are [[presentable (âˆž,1)-category|presented]] by [[model categories]], then the notion of $(\infty,1)$-site apears as that of

* [[model site]].
