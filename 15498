Iâ€™m very excited about New Yorkâ€™s bikeshare program, and look forward to using it regularly. I hope that the increase in the number of cyclists will help bring a bit more civility to New Yorkâ€™s biking community, especially in terms of stopping at lights and riding in the right direction. Meanwhile, my biggest fear is that weâ€™ll see the opposite: a bunch of people who have no idea what theyâ€™re doing, riding on sidewalks, salmoning, and generally causing chaos. I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s probable, but itâ€™s possible, and I look forward to Citibike and NYC doing everything they can to prevent it from happening. As they do so, Liuâ€™s report â€” if not his press release â€” is likely to be quite helpful.A couple of weeks ago,  had an intriguing story: Mortgage Resolution Partners, a politically well-connected firm in San Francisco, was shopping to municipalities the idea of using eminent domain to restructure mortgages. Then, on Tuesday, Cornell Universityâ€™s  weighed in, saying that the idea was a compelling one. â€œTo solve a collective action problem, we need a collective agent,â€ he wrote. â€œThatâ€™s what governments are.â€
