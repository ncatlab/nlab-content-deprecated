More to the point, I simply donâ€™t believe Cohen when he writes that he only breaks the red-light rule â€œif and only if no pedestrian is in the crosswalk and no car is in the intersectionâ€. What about when thereâ€™s a pedestrian in the crosswalk whoâ€™s walking away from the bike? Iâ€™ll bet he does it then, too. The point is, when you can make up your own rules, you can also make up when to bend them. I can understand that Cohen would prefer it if New York had rules like Idahoâ€™s. But whatever the rules are, we should obey them. If Cohen wants to agitate for a change in the rules, Iâ€™ll join him and support him. But Iâ€™m not going to pretend that itâ€™s OK to break the rules just because you think the rules should be changed.
