Bharucha, like Campbell before him, is intensely focused on improving Cooper Unionâ€™s name recognition. Cooper Union has historically not been very well known, even among New Yorkers: they often think itâ€™s some kind of labor union, rather than an undergraduate college. Thatâ€™s fine: the people who matter â€” the teenagers applying to the art school, the entire architectural profession â€” know exactly what Cooper Union is, and what it stands for. Not every non-profit organization needs its own awareness campaign â€” but of course if Cooper Union now has to start attracting richer kids capable of paying $20,000 a year in tuition, itâ€™s going to have to start marketing itself more aggressively. Again, thatâ€™s not something it historically ever wanted or needed to do, and itâ€™s not something Peter Cooper would be remotely happy about. His resources were meant to go towards education, not towards marketing and billing and â€œdevelopmentâ€.
