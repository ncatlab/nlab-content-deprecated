###### Definition

Polynomial (âˆž,1)-functors, sometimes known simply as *polynomial functors* (but not to be confused with [[polynomial functors]]), are (âˆž,1)-functors which are [[n-excisive (âˆž,1)-functor|n-excisive]] for some $n$. Such a functor has degree $k$ when the smallest value of $n$ for which it is $n$-excisive is $k$. 

An (âˆž,1)-functor can be approximated by polynomial (âˆž,1)-functors of any degree.

###### Remark

A polynomial (âˆž,1)-functor of degree $k$ is a **homogeneous** polynomial if its approximation by an $(k-1)$ degree polynomial is trivial.
