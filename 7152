## Idea

The notion of _Ã©tale homotopy_ can be understood as a vast generalization of the following classical fact.

The [[nerve theorem]] says that for $X$ a [[paracompact topological space]] and $\{U_i \to X\}$ a [[good cover]] of $X$ by open subsets, then the [[simplicial set]] obtained from the [[Cech nerve]] of the covering by degreewise contracting all connected components to a point, presents the [[homotopy type]] of $X$.

If $X$ here is more generally a [[locally contractible space]] there is in general no notion of "good" enough open cover anymore. Instead, one can consider the above kind of construction for _all_ [[hypercovers]] and take the [[limit]] over the resulting simplicial sets. The classical theorem by [Artin-Mazur](#ArtinMazur) states that this still gives the [[homotopy type]] of $X$.

The construction itself, however, makes sense for arbitrary topological spaces and in fact for arbitrary [[sites]]. 

In the literature, particularly the _[[Ã©tale site]]_ is often considered and "Ã©tale homotopy" is often implicitly understood to take place over this site. 

But the concept is much more general. In particular, one can understand the construction of the limit over contractions of [[hypercovers]] as a presentation of naturally defined [[(âˆž,1)-functors]] in [[(âˆž,1)-topos theory]]. 

Notably, if the given site is a a [[locally âˆž-connected site]], then the Ã©tale homotopy construction computes precisely the [[derived functor]] that presents the [[fundamental âˆž-groupoid in a locally âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]]. Many constructions in the literature can be understood as being explicit realizations of this simple general concept. Detailed discussion of this is at _[[geometric homotopy groups in an (âˆž,1)-topos]]_.

Even more generally, Ã©tale homotopy give the notion of [[shape of an (âˆž,1)-topos]]. (...)

## Examples
 {#Examples}

### Chevalley groups and Galois groups

For the special case of [[fundamental groups]], the concept of Ã©tale homotopy groups also goes by the name of _[[Chevalley fundamental groups]]_.

The Ã©tale fundamental group of a [[scheme]] is its [[absolute Galois group]]. See at _[Galois theory -- Statement of the main result](Galois+theory#StatementOfMainTheorem)_.

###### Example

For $k$ a [[field]] of [[characteristic]] 0, then the [[affine line]] $\mathbb{A}^1_k$ is Ã©tale [[contractible homotopy type|contractible]]. This is no longer the case in [[positive number|positive]] [[characteristic]].

###### Proposition


Let $k$ be an [[algebraically closed field]] of [[positive number|positive]] [[characteristic]]. Then the only [[smooth variety]] over $k$ which is Ã©tale [[contractible homotopy type|contractible]] is the point $Spec(k)$. In fact this is the only smooth variety which is [[n-connected object of an (infinity,1)-topos|2-connected]].
