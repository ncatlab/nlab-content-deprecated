## Idea

The notion of _Ã©tale homotopy_ can be understood as a vast generalization of the following classical fact.

The [[nerve theorem]] says that for $X$ a [[paracompact topological space]] and $\{U_i \to X\}$ a [[good cover]] of $X$ by open subsets, then the [[simplicial set]] obtained from the [[Cech nerve]] of the covering by degreewise contracting all connected components to a point, presents the [[homotopy type]] of $X$.

If $X$ here is more generally a [[locally contractible space]] there is in general no notion of "good" enough open cover anymore. Instead, one can consider the above kind of construction for _all_ [[hypercovers]] and take the [[limit]] over the resulting simplicial sets. The classical theorem by [Artin-Mazu](#ArtinMazur) states that this still gives the [[homotopy type]] of $X$.

The construction itself, however, makes sense for arbitrary topological spaces and in fact for arbitrary [[sites]]. 

In the literature, particularly the _[[Ã©tale site]]_ is often considered and "Ã©tale homotopy" is often implicitly understood to take place over this site. 

But the concept is much more general. In particular, one can understand the construction of the limit over contractions of [[hypercovers]] as a presentation of naturally defined [[(âˆž,1)-functors]] in [[(âˆž,1)-topos theory]]. 

Notably, if the given site is a a [[locally âˆž-connected site]], then the Ã©tale homotopy construction computes precisey the [[derived functor]] that presents the [[fundamental âˆž-groupoid in a locally âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]]. Many constructions in the literature can be understood as being explicit realizations of this simple general concept. Detailed discussion of this is at _[[geometric homotopy groups in an (âˆž,1)-topos]]_.

Even more generally, Ã©tale homotopy give the notion of [[shape of an (âˆž,1)-topos]]. (...)
