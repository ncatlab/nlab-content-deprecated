
Georg Philipp Friedrich Freiherr von Hardenberg (Novalis) (May 2, 1772 â€“ March 25, 1801), was a German Romantic poet, philosopher, author, scientific polymath, and salt-mine manager. He is distinguished from the other German Romantics in that he is the only one who was academically qualified and professionally trained in the sciences. He undertook a grand philosophico-poetic-scientific encyclopedia project - the _Allgemeine Brouillon_ - and encapsulated this project in narrative form in _The Disciples at Sais_, among other things. As evinced by the mathematical fragments below, mathematics held much importance in his work.

### Mathematical Fragments

* â€œIn the end, mathematics is only common, simple philosophy, and philoso- phy, is higher mathematics in general. In particular, higher mathematics connects common mathematics with the system of mathematics, while the latter borders on the philosophy of mathemat- icsâ€”or philosophical mathematics, just as systematic science is generally always the precursor and boundary of a higher degree of scienceâ€”of the philosophical degree.222 (Degrees of scientific character. The highest degree of scientific character would be termed philosophy). The philosophical degree again divides into 3 parts and immediatelyâ€”passes over into the higher series, or into the higher de- gree of the philosophy of philosophy, and so on. (Just as the man of nature passes over into the common and complex human being, so too pure science into the common and higher. Higher science is the transition to a system, just as the scholar, or complex man is the transition to the systematist).â€

* â€œ(Has philosophy originated from the contemplation of mathematics?) Philosophy is universalâ€”or higher mathematicsâ€”the animating principle of mathematicsâ€”poetical mathematicsâ€”Or the substance, if mathematics is the form. Mathematics is merely objective philosophyâ€”formal philosophyâ€”and so- called philosophyâ€”is merely subjective philosophy or mathematicsâ€”real philoso- phy. By combining them in a manner analogous to that of the combination of chemistry and mechanicsâ€”there arises substantialâ€”syntheticâ€”philosophyâ€”or mathematics, or physics. Contrasted with philosophy, physics is mathematicsâ€” while contrasted with mathematicsâ€”it is philosophyâ€

* â€œAll the universal sciencesâ€”e.g. physics and mathematics, etc., really resemble philosophy in one respectâ€”they are Proteussesâ€”universal substancesâ€”indications etc.â€

* â€œThe mathematical method is the essence of mathematics. Whoever fully understands this method, is a mathematician. As the scientific method in general it is extremely interesting, and perhaps supplies us with the most accurate model for the classification of knowledge, or for the faculty of experience. Axioms and postulates denote the theoretical (a.) and practical (b.) cognitive faculty as such. Problems denote the desire. Solution and proof, the analytic (ad a.) and synthetic (ad b.) ability. Explanations and corollaries also have their significance. This reveals that our desire for knowledge is the intelligenceâ€™s desire for life, a play of intellectual forces.â€

* â€œMathematics is genuine scienceâ€”because it contains created knowledgeâ€”the products of its own spiritual activityâ€”and because it methodically inspires. It is art, because it has fashioned inspired procedures into rulesâ€”because it teaches one to be a geniusâ€”and because it replaces Nature with reason. Higher mathematics is concerned with the spirit of quantitiesâ€”with their political principleâ€”with the world of quantitiesâ€

* â€œAll sciences should become mathematics. Up to now, mathematics has merely been the first and simplest expression or revelation of true scientific spirit.â€

* â€œThe external is the common. The internal, is the particular./ The inte- gration is much more difficult than the differentiation. In relation to physics and philosophy./ The science that joins and puts both into contact with one anotherâ€”that instructs in deriving the particular from the common, and the inverse, as well as with the external and internal aspectsâ€”this science is the connectingâ€”and higher science. If the first is quantative mathematics, and the second qualitative mathe- matics, then the third is relative mathematicsâ€”which appear in four systems of elements and in a single universal system.â€

* â€œThe highest life is mathematics.â€

* â€œPure mathematics is religion.â€

* â€œPure mathematics is the intuition of the intellect as a universe. Genuine mathematics is the actual element of the magician â€¦ In music it appears formally, as revelation - as creative idealismâ€

### Rondas en Sais

[[Fernando Zalamea]] edited a Spanish language volume which updates Novalis in light of contemporary mathematics, culture, and philosophy:

* _Rondas en Sais. Ensayos sobre matemÃ¡ticas y cultura contemporÃ¡nea_ introduce algunos desarrollos profundos en matemÃ¡ticas modernas (1830-1950: Galois, Riemann, Peirce, Florenski) y contemporÃ¡neas (1950-hoy: Grothendieck, Connes, Lawvere, Shelah, Zilber), para luego reflexionar sobre las transformaciones que esos avances han producido y pueden llegar a producir en el Ã¡mbito general de la cultura, aquÃ­ explorada a travÃ©s de diversas vertientes (filosofÃ­a, literatura, cine, arte). En homenaje a Los DiscÃ­pulos de Sais de Novalis, y continuando con la simbiosis de filosofÃ­a natural y la especulativa presente en su clarividente borrador general, Rondas en Sais reÃºne ensayos expresamente preparados para esta ocasiÃ³n por reconocidos especialistas del mundo hispÃ¡nico en historia y filosofÃ­a de las matemÃ¡ticas. Con ello se registra un estado de la cuestiÃ³n por primera vez a nivel internacional y se plantean problemÃ¡ticas a desarrollar en el futuro prÃ³ximo. El pensamiento matemÃ¡tico avanzado ha explorado con sumo detalle algunas fuerzas directrices trÃ¡nsitos fronterizos, contaminaciones estructurales, deformaciones conceptuales, fluxiones plÃ¡ticas, procesos reflexivos, por ejemplo que han permeado la cultura en el Ãºltimo medio siglo, y que han sido rara vez estudiadas desde la riqueza de los trasfondos matemÃ¡ticos subyacentes. Rondas en Sais pretende cubrir en parte esa ausencia y ayudar a hacer comprender la matemÃ¡tica como un pensamiento dinÃ¡mico, imprescindible, parte integral de la cultura como un todo.
