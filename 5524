## Definition

Let $C := $[[ThCartSp]] be the [[site]] of infintiesimally thickened [[Cartesian space]]s and [[smooth function]]s between them, equipped with the [[coverage]] of [[good open cover]]s on the finite factors. (A site of definition of the [[Cahiers topos]].)

Write

$$
  SynthDiff \infty Grpd := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(ThCartSp)
$$

for the [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-sheaves]] on $ThCartSp$. 

Since $ThCartSp$ is an [[âˆž-cohesive site]], this is a [[cohesive (âˆž,1)-topos]]. We may think of its (concrete) objects as being [[âˆž-groupoid]]s equipped with [[smooth structure]] in the fashion of [[Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis|standard models]] of [[synthetic differential geometry]].

Therefore we call an object in $SynthDiff \infty Grpd$ a **synthetic differential $\infty$-groupoid**.

By restriction along the morphism of sites [[CartSp]] $\to$ [[ThCartSp]] every synthetic differential $\infty$-groupoid has an underlying [[smooth âˆž-groupoid]].
