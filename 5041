This establishes a statement (theorem 5.3) that characterizes [[âˆž-stack]]s (over an [[(âˆž,1)-site]] of formal duals of [[E-infinity-ring|E-âˆž algebra]]s over a [[field]]) such that

1. they have a contractible underlying [[âˆž-groupoid]]

   $$
    \Gamma X \simeq *
   $$

   (in the terminology and notation for [[cohesive (âˆž,1)-topos]]es) 

1. and respect [[(âˆž,1)-limit|(âˆž,1)-pullback]]s

with those arising by [[Lie integration]] from an [[âˆž-Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$

$$
  X \simeq \exp(\mathfrak{g})
  \,.
