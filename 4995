## Idea

A _cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos_ is a [[big topos|big]] [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ that provides a context of generalized [[space]]s in which [[higher geometry]] makes sense. 

It is an $(\infty,1)$-topos whose [[global section]] [[(âˆž,1)-geometric morphism]] $(Disc \dashv \Gamma): \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}} $ [[âˆžGrpd]] admits a further [[left adjoint|left]] [[adjoint (âˆž,1)-functor]] $\Pi$ and a further right adjoint $coDisc$: 

$$
  (\Pi \dashv Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv coDisc) : \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd
$$ 

with $Disc$ and $coFisc$ both [[full and faithful (âˆž,1)-functor]]s and such that $\Pi$ moreover preserves finite [[(âˆž,1)-limit|(âˆž,1)-product]]s. Here

1. the existence of $coDisc$ induces a sub-[[(âˆž,1)-quasitopos]] $Conc(\mathbf{H}) \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ of _[[concrete (âˆž,1)-sheaf|concrete objects]]_ that behave like [[âˆž-groupoid]]s _equipped with extra cohesive structure_ , such as with [[topology|continuous structure]], [[smooth structure]], etc.

1. the existence of $\Pi$ induces a notion of [[geometric homotopy groups in an (âˆž,1)-topos|geometric]] [[fundamental âˆž-groupoid in a locally âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos|fundamental âˆž-groupoid]], hence under $|-| : \infty Grpd \simeq $ [[Top]] of [[geometric realization]] $|\Pi(-)|$ of objects in $\mathbf{H}$.

The functor $\Gamma$ itself may be thought of as sending a cohesive [[âˆž-groupoid]] $X$ to its underlying bare $\infty$-groupoid $\Gamma(X)$. This is $X$ with all _cohesion forgotten_ (for instance with the continuous or the smooth structure forgotten).

Conversely, $Disc$ and $CoDisc$ send an $\infty$-groupoid $A$ either to the [[discrete space|discrete âˆž-groupoid]] $Disc(A)$ with _discrete_ cohesive structure (for instance with [[discrete topology]]) or to the [[codiscrete space|codiscrete âˆž-groupoid]] $Codisc(A)$ with the _codiscrete_ cohesive structure (for instance with [[codiscrete topology]]). 

The existence of such an [[adjoint quadruple]] of adjoint $(\infty,1)$-functors alone implies a rich [[internalization|internal]] [[higher geometry]] in $\mathbf{H}$ that comes with its internal notion of [[Galois theory]], [[Lie theory]], [[differential cohomology]], [[Chern-Weil theory]]. 

Examples of cohesive $(\infty,1)$-toposes include

* the $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H} = $[[DiscâˆžGrpd]] of [[discrete âˆž-groupoid]]s; 

* the $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H} = $ [[ETopâˆžGrpd]] of [[Euclidean-topological âˆž-groupoids]];

* the $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H} = $ [[SmoothâˆžGrpd]] of [[smooth âˆž-groupoids]]; 

* the $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H} = $ [[SynthDiffâˆžGrpd]] of [[synthetic differential âˆž-groupoids]];

* the $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H} = $ [[SuperâˆžGrpd]] of [[super âˆž-groupoids]];

* the $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H} = $ [[SmoothSuperâˆžGrpd]] of [[smooth super âˆž-groupoids]].

In [[ETopâˆžGrpd]] and those contexts containing it, the internal notions of  [[geometric realization]], [[geometric homotopy groups in an (infinity,1)-topos|geometric homotopy]] and [[Galois theory]] subsume the usual ones (over well-behaved topological spaces). In [[SmoothâˆžGrpd]] also the notions of [[Lie theory]], [[differential cohomology]] and [[Chern-Weil theory]] subsume the usual ones. In [[SynthDiffâˆžGrpd]] the internal notion of [[Lie algebra]] and [[Lie algebroid]] subsumes the traditional one --- and generalizes them to higher smooth geometry.


## Definition


We state the definition in several equivalent ways.

1. [externally](#ExternalDefinition) in the ambient context;

1. [internally](#InternalDefinition) to the cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos itselfs;

1. internally and [formulated in homotopy type theory](#DefinitionInHomotopyTypeTheory)


### Externally
 {#ExternalDefinition}

The definition is the immediate analog of the definition of a [[cohesive topos]].


+-- {: .num_defn #CohesiveInfinTopos}
###### Definition

An [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ is **cohesive** if

1. it is a [[strongly âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]];

1. it is a [[local (âˆž,1)-topos]].


=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark


As always in [[topos theory]] and [[higher topos theory]], such definitions can be made sense of over any _base_ . Here: over any [[base (âˆž,1)-topos]].

Over the canonical base [[âˆžGrpd]] of [[âˆž-groupoid]]s, the definition of a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos is equivalently the following:

the [[global section]] [[(âˆž,1)-geometric morphism]] lifts to an [[adjoint quadruple]] of [[adjoint (âˆž,1)-functor]]s
   
$$
  (f_! \dashv f^* \dashv f_* \dashv f^!) : 
  \mathbf{H}
   \stackrel{\stackrel{\overset{f_!}{\to}}{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}}{\stackrel{\underset{f_*}{\to}}{\underset{f^!}{\leftarrow}}}
  \infty Grpd
  \;
$$

where $f_!$ preserves [[finite limit|finite]] [[(âˆž,1)-product]]s.

Often we will tacitly assume to work over [[âˆžGrpd]]. But most statements and constructions have straightforward generalizations to arbitrary bases.
In particular, below in the [internal definition](#InternalDefinition) of cohesion, it takes more to fix the base topos than to leave it arbitrary.

=--


Sometimes it is desireable to add further axioms, such as the following.

+-- {: .num_defn #PiecesHavePoints}
###### Definition

We say that **pieces have points** for an object
$X$ in a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}$ 
if the morphism

$$
  \Gamma X \to \Gamma Disc \Pi X \simeq \Pi X
$$ 

is an [[effective epimorphism in an (âˆž,1)-category]], equivalently (as discussed there) such that this is an [[epimorphism]] on [[connected]] components.


=--

Here the first morphismism is the image under $\Gamma$ of the 
$(Disc \dashv \Gamma)$-[[unit of an adjunction|unit]] and the second is an inverse of the $(\Pi \dashv Disc)$-counit (which is invertible because $Disc$ is [[full and faithful (âˆž,1)-functor|full and faithful]] in a [[local (âˆž,1)-topos]].)

+-- {: .num_defn #DiscreteObjectsAreConcrete}
###### Definition

We say **discrete objects are concrete** in $\mathbf{H}$ if for all
$S \in $[[âˆžGrpd]] the morphism

$$
  Disc S \to coDisc \Gamma Disc S \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} coDisc S
$$

induces [[monomorphism]]s on all [[categorical homotopy groups in an (infinity,1)-topos|homotopy sheaves]].

=--


### Internally
 {#InternalDefinition}

We reformulate the [above axioms](#ExternalDefinition) for a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos without references to functors _on_ it, and instead entirely in terms of structures _in_ it.

+-- {: .num_lemma #ReflectiveEmbeddingInternally}
###### Lemma

A [[full sub-(âˆž,1)-category]] $\mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ is

* [[reflective sub-(âˆž,1)-category|reflectively embedded]] precisely if for every [[object]] $X \in \mathbf{H}$ there is a [[morphism]] 

  $$
    loc_X : X \to L X
  $$ 

  (the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]]) with $L X \in \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ such that for all $Y \in \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ the value of the [[(âˆž,1)-categorical hom-space]]-functor 

  $$
    \mathbf{H}(loc_X, Y) : 
    \mathbf{H}(L X, Y)
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
    \mathbf{H}(X, Y)
  $$

  is an [[equivalence in an (âˆž,1)-category|equivalence]] (of [[âˆž-groupoid]]s). 

* coreflectively embedded precisely if for every [[object]] $Y \in \mathbf{H}$ there is a [[morphism]] 

  $$
    coloc_Y : R Y \to Y
  $$ 

  (the [[unit of an adjunction|counit]]) with $R Y \in \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ such that for all $X \in \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ the value of the [[(âˆž,1)-categorical hom-space]]-functor 

  $$
    \mathbf{H}(X, coloc_Y) : 
    \mathbf{H}(X, R Y)
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
    \mathbf{H}(X, Y)
  $$

  is an [[equivalence in an (âˆž,1)-category|equivalence]] (of [[âˆž-groupoid]]s). 


=--

This is proven [here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflective+sub-%28infinity,1%29-category#CharacterizationOfReflectors).

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma

A reflective embedding 

$$
  coDisc : \mathbf{B}_{cod} \stackrel{\overset{\tilde \Gamma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{coDisc}{\hookrightarrow}} \mathbf{H}
$$

and a coreflective embedding 

$$
  Disc : \mathbf{B}_{disc} \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\hookrightarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}} \mathbf{H}
$$

fit into a single [[adjoint triple]]

$$
  \mathbf{H}
    \stackrel{
      \overset{Disc}{\hookleftarrow}
    }{
     \stackrel{  
       \overset{\Gamma}{\to}
     }{
       \underset{coDisc}{\hookleftarrow}
     }
   }
  \mathbf{B}
$$

(hence the coreflector $\tilde\Gamma$ of $Disc$ coincides with reflector $\Gamma$ of $coDisc$) precisely if for the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] and counit given by  lemma \ref{ReflectiveEmbeddingInternally} we have that

1. $coDisc \tilde \Gamma (Disc \Gamma X \to X)$

1. $Disc \Gamma (X \to coDisc \tilde \Gamma X)$

are [[equivalence in an (âˆž,1)-category|equivalences]] for all objects $X \in \mathbf{H}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear that if we have an [[adjoint triple]], then the indicated equivalences are implied. We discuss the converse.

First notice that the two embeddings combine to an adjunction

$$
  \mathbf{B}_{disc}
   \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\hookrightarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}}
  \mathbf{H}
   \stackrel{\overset{\tilde \Gamma}{\to}}{\underset{coDisc}{\hookleftarrow}}
  \mathbf{B}_{cod}    
  \,.
$$

Then the equivalence $coDisc \tilde \Gamma Disc \Gamma X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} coDisc \tilde \Gamma X$ applied to a codiscrete object $X := coDisc A$ gives that $coDisc$ of the counit of this composite adjunction is an equivalence 

$$
  coDisc \tilde \Gamma Disc \Gamma coDisc A
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  coDisc \tilde \Gamma coDisc A
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  coDisc A
$$

for all $A$, and since $coDisc$ is full and faithful, so is the counit 

$$
  \tilde \Gamma Disc \Gamma coDisc A
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  \tilde \Gamma coDisc A
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  A  
$$

itself. Similarly, the second assumption implies that the unit of the adjunction is an equivalence. Therefore the two assumptions together imply that the adjunction itself exhibits an [[equivalence of (âˆž,1)-categories]] $\mathbf{B}_{disc} \simeq \mathbf{B}_{cod}$.

Using this we then find for each $X \in \mathbf{H}$ a composite natural equivalence

$$
  Disc \tilde \Gamma X
   \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  Disc \Gamma coDisc \tilde \Gamma X
   \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  Disc \Gamma X
$$

where the first morphism uses the above equivalence on the codiscrete object $\tilde X$ and the second is from one of the two assumption.

Since $Disc$ is full and faithful, this mean that we have equivalences

$$
  \tilde \Gamma X \simeq 
  \Gamma X
$$

natural in $X$, hence that $\tilde \Gamma \simeq \Gamma$.

=--

Accordingly we have

+-- {: .num_corollary}
###### Corollary

The reflective and coreflective embedding $Disc : \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ of [[discrete âˆž-groupoid]]s in a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos is equivalent to the existence, for every object $X \in \mathbf{H}$, of 

1. a morphism $X \to \mathbf{\Pi}(X)$ with $\mathbf{\Pi}(X) \in \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$;

1. a morphism $\mathbf{\flat} X \to X$ with $\mathbf{\flat} X \in \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$;

such that for all $Y \in \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ the induced morphisms

1. $\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{\Pi}X , Y) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathbf{H}(X,Y)$;

1. $\mathbf{H}(Y, \mathbf{\flat}X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathbf{H}(Y,X)$;

are equivalences, as indicated.

The reflective embedding $coDisc$ is analogously equivalent to the existence for every $X$ of a morphism $X \to #X$, such that, etc.

and such that for all $X \in \mathbf{H}$ the morphisms

1. $#(\mathbf{\flat} X \to X)$

1. $\mathbf{\flat}(X \to # X)$

are equivalences.

The fact that $\Pi$ preserves the terminal object is equivalent to the morphism $* \to \mathbf{\Pi}(*)$ being an equivalence.

### Formulation in homotopy type theory
  {#DefinitionInHomotopyTypeTheory}

We give the [internal definition](#InternalDefinition) of a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos in the formal language of [[homotopy type theory]].

    Require Import Homotopy Utf8.

There is a full subcategory of objects called _discrete_ .

    Axiom is_discrete : Type â†’ Type.

    Axiom is_discrete_is_prop: âˆ€ X, is_prop (is_discrete X).

Every object has a reflection into a discrete object.

    Axiom pi : Type â†’ Type.

    Axiom pi_is_discrete : âˆ€ X, is_discrete (pi X).

    Axiom map_to_pi : âˆ€ X, X â†’ pi X.

    Axiom pi_is_reflection : âˆ€ X Y, is_discrete Y â†’ is_equiv (fun f: pi X â†’ Y => f â—‹ (map_to_pi X)).

The reflector preserves the terminal object.

    Axiom pi_preserve_terminal: is_equiv (map_to_pi unit).

Every object has a coreflection from a discrete object.
 
    Axiom flat: Type â†’ Type.

    Axiom flat_is_discrete : âˆ€ X, is_discrete (flat X).

    Axiom map_from_flat : âˆ€ X, flat X â†’ X.

    Axiom flat_is_coreflection: âˆ€ X Y, is_discrete Y â†’ is_equiv (fun f : Y â†’ flat X => (map_from_flat X) â—‹ f).

There is a full subcategory of objects called _codiscrete_ . 

    Axiom is_codiscrete : Type â†’ Type.

    Axiom is_codiscrete_is_prop: âˆ€ X, is_prop (is_codiscrete X).

Every object has a reflection into a codiscrete object.

    Axiom conc : Type â†’ Type.

    Axiom conc_is_codiscrete : âˆ€ X, is_codiscrete (conc X).

    Axiom map_to_conc : âˆ€ X, X â†’ conc X.

    Axiom conc_is_reflection : âˆ€ X Y, is_codiscrete Y â†’ is_equiv (fun f: conc X â†’ Y => f â—‹ (map_to_con X)).

The following says that the coreflector of the discrete objects coincides with the reflector of the codiscrete objects.

## Properties


### As a point-like space



+-- {: .num_prop #PointLike}
###### Proposition

A nontrivial cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos

1. has the [[shape of an (âˆž,1)-topos|shape]] of the point;

1. has [[homotopy dimension]] 0;

1. has [[cohomology dimension]] 0.
 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first holds for every [[âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]], see there.

The second holds for every [[local (âˆž,1)-topos]], see there.

The third follows from the second, see [[homotopy dimension]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #ThickenedPoint}
###### Remark

This says that a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}$ is, when itself regarded as a [[little topos]], a generalized [[space]], a _thickened point_ . We may think of it as the standard [[point]] equipped with a _cohesive neighbourhood_ .

In this sense every space $X$ _modeled on_ the cohesive structure defined by $\mathbf{H}$ is an [[Ã©tale space]] over $X$: its [[petit topos|petit]] $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}/X$ sits by a [[locally homeomorphic geometric morphism]] over $\mathbf{H}$

$$
  \mathbf{H}/X \stackrel{local\;homeo}{\to} \mathbf{H}
  \,.
$$

###### Proposition

Every cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos is a 
[[hypercomplete (âˆž,1)-topos]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


By the [above proposition](#PointLike) it has finite 
[[homotopy dimension]]. This implies hypercompeteness. See there.

+-- {: .num_prop #Cohesive1Topos}
###### Proposition

For $\mathbf{H}$ a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos, the [[(n,1)-topos|(1,1)-topos]] $\tau_{\leq 1-1} \mathbf{H}$ of 0-[[truncated]] objects is a [[cohesive topos]].

### Over an $\infty$-cohesive site

We discuss a [[presentable (âˆž,1)-category|presentation]] of classes of cohesive [[(âˆž,1)-topos]]es by a [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] over a suitable [[site]].


+-- {: .num_prop #SimplicialPresheavesOverInfinityCohesviveSite}
###### Proposition

For $C$ an [[âˆž-cohesive site] the [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-sheaves]] $(\infty,1)Sh(C)$ over $C$ is a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos satisfying the two axioms _[pieces have points](#PiecesHavePoints)_ and _[discrete objects are concrete](#DiscreteObjectsAreConcrete)_ .

## Structures in a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos {#Structures}

A cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos is a general context for [[higher geometry]] with good [[cohomology]] and [[homotopy]] properties. We list fundamental structures and constructions that exist in every cohesvive $(\infty,1)$-topos.

##  Infinitesimal cohesion   
  {#InfinitesimalCohesion}

We discuss [[extra structure]] on a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos
that encodes a refinement of the corresponding notion of cohesion to 
_infinitesimal cohesion_ . More precisely, we consider inclusions
$\mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}_{th}$ of cohesive 
$(\infty,1)$-toposes that exhibit the objects of $\mathbf{H}_{th}$
as infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhoods of objects in 
$\mathbf{H}$.

* [[cohesive (âˆž,1)-topos -- infinitesimal cohesion]]

## Locally ringed cohesion

Every cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}$ equipped with 
[infinitesimal cohesion](#InfinitesimalCohesion) comes canonically equipped with a notion of [[formally Ã©tale morphism]]s (as discussed there). Combined with the canonical interpretation of $\mathbf{H}$ as the [[classifying topos]] of a [[theory]] of [[local algebra|local T-algebra]]s, this caninically induces a notion of [[locally algebra-ed topos|locally algebra-ed (âˆž,1)-toposes]] with cohesive structure, generalizing the notion of [[locally ringed space]]s and [[locally ringed topos]]es.

* [[cohesive (âˆž,1)-topos -- structure âˆž-sheaves]].


## Examples {#Examples}

###### Proposition

Examples of [[âˆž-cohesive site]]s are

* any category with finite [[product]]s and equipped with the trivial [[coverage]].

* the [[full subcategory]] $CartSp_{top} \subset$ [[Top]] on [[open ball]]s with the [[good open cover]] [[coverage]];

* the site [[CartSp]] of [[Cartesian space]]s with [[smooth function]]s between them and [[good open cover]] [[coverage]].

* the [[Cahiers topos]]-site [[ThCartSp]] of infinitesimally thickened Cartesian spaces.
