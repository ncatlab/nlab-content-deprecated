The [[Kan complex]] definition of [[âˆž-groupoid]] may be immediately [[internalization|internalized]] to an arbitrary category. Namely, if $C$ is a [[category]], an __$\infty$-$C$-groupoid__ (or __$\infty$-groupoid in $C$__) is a [[Kan object]] in $C$, i.e., a [[simplicial object]] in $C$ which satisfies the Kan conditions. In this sense, an $\infty$-groupoid is a $\infty$-$Set$-groupoid (an $\infty$-groupoid in [[Set]]). 

A classical example consists of the __topological $\infty$-groupoids__. The [[nerve]] construction makes a topological $\infty$-groupoid from a [[topological groupoid]]. This is actually a characterization of topological groupoids among topological categories.

In particular, if $G$ is a [[topological group]], then $N(\mathbf{B}G)$ is a topological $\infty$-groupoid. This is relevant to the construction of the [[classifying space]]s for continuous [[principal bundle]]s.

Another classical example consists of the [[âˆž-Lie groupoids]].
