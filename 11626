## Idea

The canonical [[line bundle]] on the [[product]] of an [[abelian group]] ([[abelian variety]]) and its dual [[Picard scheme]]. Alternatively its [[sheaf]] of [[sections]]: the _PoincarÃ© sheaf_.


## References

The idea is briefly summarized in 

* [[Akhil Mathew]], section 10 of _[Duality for abelian varieties](http://amathew.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/duality-for-abelian-varieties/)_
