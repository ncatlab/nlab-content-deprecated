###### Definition

An [[(âˆž,1)-functor]] $F \colon \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}$ out of an [[(âˆž,1)-category]] with [[finite (âˆž,1)-colimits]] is **excisive** if it takes [[(âˆž,1)-pushout]] squares in $\mathcal{C}$ to [[(âˆž,1)-pullback]] squares $\mathcal{D}$. 

This is the $n=1$ case of the concept [[n-excisive (âˆž,1)-functor]].

The notion of [[n-excisive functors]] was introduced in 

* [[Thomas Goodwillie]], _Calculus II, Analytic functors_, K-Theory 5 (1991/92), no. 4, 295-332

The [[Taylor tower]] formed by $n$-excisive functors was then studied in
