## Classical case

The classical **Whitehead theorem** asserts that 

+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem (Whitehead)

Every [[weak homotopy equivalence]] between [[CW-complex]]es is a [[homotopy equivalence]].

=--

(See also the discussion at [[m-cofibrant space]]).

Using the [[homotopy hypothesis]]-theorem this may be reformulated:

+-- {: .un_cor }
###### Corollary

In the [[(âˆž,1)-category]] [[âˆž Grpd]] every [[weak homotopy equivalence]] is a [[homotopy equivalence]].

=--


## In general $(\infty,1)$-toposes 

There is a notion of [[homotopy group]]s for objects in every [[âˆž-stack]] [[(âˆž,1)-topos]], as described at [[homotopy group (of an âˆž-stack)]]. Accordingly, there is a notion of [[weak homotopy equivalence]] in every [[âˆž-stack]] [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] and hence an analog of the statement of Whiteheads theorem. One finds that

**Warning** Whitehead's theorem **fails** for general [[(âˆž,1)-topos]]es.

The [[âˆž-stack]] [[(âˆž,1)-topos]]es in which the Whitehead theorem does hold are the [[hypercomplete (âˆž,1)-topos]]es. These are precisely the ones that are [[presentable (âˆž,1)-category|presented]] by a local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]. 

For instance the hypercomplete $(\infty,1)$-topos [[Top]] is presented by the model structure on simplicial presheaves on the point, namely the [[model structure on simplicial sets]].
