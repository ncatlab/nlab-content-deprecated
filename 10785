## Idea

A variant of [[Ã©tale morphism of schemes]] where the finitess conditions on [[Ã©tale morphisms]] are relaxed.

Used in the definition of _[[pro-Ã©tale site]]_ and _[[pro-Ã©tale cohomology]]_.

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #WeaklyEtale}
###### Definition

A [[morphism]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ of [[schemes]]
is called _weakly Ã©tale_ if 

1. $f$ is a [[flat morphism of schemes]];

1. its [[diagonal]] $X \longrightarrow X \times_Y X$ is also flat.

###### Proposition

Every [[weakly Ã©tale morphism]] is a [[formally Ã©tale morphism]].

###### Remark

As discussed there, an [[Ã©tale morphism]] is a [[formally Ã©tale morphism]] which is [[locally of finite presentation]].

###### Corollary

A [[weakly Ã©tale morphism]] which is [[locally of finite presentation]] is an [[Ã©tale morphism of schemes|Ã©tale morphism]].

[[Ã©tale morphism of schemes|Ã©tale morphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[weakly Ã©tale morphism of schemes|weakly Ã©tale morphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[formally Ã©tale morphism of schemes|formally Ã©tale morphism]]

In fact a weakly Ã©tale morphism is equivalently a [[formally Ã©tale morphism]] which is "locally [[pro-object|pro-finitely]] presentable" (dually locally of [[ind-object|ind]]-finite rank) in the following sense

+-- {: .num_defn #IndEtale}
###### Definition

For $A \to B$ a [[homomorphism]] of [[rings]], say that it is an **[[ind-Ã©tale morphism]]** if that $A$-[[associative algebra|algebra]] $B$ is a [[filtered colimit]] of $A$-[[Ã©tale algebras]].

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $f \;\colon\; A \longrightarrow B$ be a [[homomorphism]] of [[rings]].

* If $f$ is ind-Ã©tale, def. \ref{IndEtale}, then it is weakly Ã©tale, def. \ref{WeaklyEtale}.

Almost conversely

* If $f$ is weakly Ã©tale, then there is a [[faithfully flat morphism]] $g \colon B \to C$ which is ind-Ã©tale such that the [[composition|composite]] $g\circ f$ is ind-Ã©tale.

+-- {: .num_cor}
###### Corollary

The [[sheaf toposes]] over the [[sites]]  of weak Ã©tale morphisms and of [[pro-Ã©tale morphisms of schemes]] into  some base [[scheme]] are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]], both define the  _[[pro-Ã©tale topos]]_ over the _[[pro-Ã©tale site]]_.
