## Idea

**LindstrÃ¶m's theorems** are important results in classical [[model theory]] due to the Swedish logician Per LindstrÃ¶m that give abstract characterizations of standard (unsorted finitary) [[first-order logic]] ('abstract' in the sense of not referring to the syntactic make up of the formulas).

The _first_ (semantic) one states that the validity of the downward [[LÃ¶wenheim-Skolem theorem]] (a sentence that holds in some model already holds in an at most countable model) and the [[compactness theorem]] (a set of sentences has a model if every finite subset has a model) characterizes up to expressive power standard first-order logic among all logics satisfying certain regularity conditions[^fine]:

[^fine]: These conditions formalize some classical background assumptions on logical systems like the restriction of semantics to standard set-theoretic structures and the existence of negation in the sense that for every sentence $\varphi$ there is $\psi$ such that $\mathfrak{A}\models\varphi$ iff not $\mathfrak{A}\models\psi$.

A gain in expressive power comes at the price of the loss of the validity of at least one of these theorems e.g. in second-order logic both theorems fail to hold. 

The _second_ LindstrÃ¶m theorem is of a more proof-theoretic nature and involves the concept of an _effective logical system_ which draws on [[computability theory]]. It achieves a characterization of standard first-order logic in the class of all effective regular logical systems by the two properties of having an enumerable set of tautologies and validity of the LÃ¶wenheim-Skolem theorem.

These results are sometimes viewed as an explanation of the privileged role that standard first-order logic plays in mathematical logic and can be viewed as the first results in [[abstract model theory]].
