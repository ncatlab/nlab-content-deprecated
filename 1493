The term _$\omega$-category_ is used more or less synonymous with [[ âˆž-category]], though the two terms appear with different frequency in different parts of the literature.

Originally, $\omega$-categories were introduced as

* [[strict Ï‰-category|strict Ï‰-categories]].

There are also 

* [[weak Ï‰-category|weak Ï‰-categories]].
