## Idea

_KÃ¤hler manifolds_ are analogues in [[complex geometry]] of [[Riemannian manifolds]] in real [[differential geometry]].


Where a Riemannian manifold is a real [[smooth manifold]] equipped with a nondegenerate smooth symmetric 2-form $g$ (the [[Riemannian metric]]), an __almost KÃ¤hler manifold__ is a [[complex manifold|complex holomorphic manifold]] equipped with a nondegenerate hermitian 2-form $h$ (the __KÃ¤hler $2$-form__).  The real [[cotangent bundle]] is replaced with the complex cotangent bundle, and symmetry is replaced with hermitian symmetry. An almost KÃ¤hler manifold is a __KÃ¤hler manifold__ if it satisfies an additional integrability condition.

The KÃ¤hler 2-form can be decomposed as $h = g+i\omega$; here $g$ is a [[Riemannian metric]] and $\omega$ a [[symplectic form]]. 

## Examples

There is a unique up to a scalar hermitian metric on a complex projective space (which can be normalized), the Fubini--Study metric. All analytic subvarieties of a complex projective space are in fact [[algebraic variety|algebraic subvarieties]] and they inherit the KÃ¤hler structure from the projective space. Examples include complex tori $\mathbb{C}^n/L$ where $L$ is a lattice in $\mathbb{C}^n$, K3-surfaces, compact Calabi-Yau manifolds, quadrics, products of projective spaces and so on.

KÃ¤hler manifolds were first introduced and studied by P. A. Shirokov (cf. [a historical article](http://dx.doi.org/10.1070/RM1995v050n02ABEH002098)) and later independently by KÃ¤hler.
