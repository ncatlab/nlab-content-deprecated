## Idea

A *totally $\infty$-connected site* is a [[site]] satisfying sufficient conditions to make the [[(âˆž,1)-sheaf (âˆž,1)-topos]] over it a [[totally âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]].


## Definition

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition


Let $C$ be an [[âˆž-connected site]]; we say it is a **strongly $\infty$-connected site** if it is also a [[cofiltered (âˆž,1)-category]].

## Properties


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

If $C$ is a totally $\infty$-connected site, then the [[(âˆž,1)-sheaf (âˆž,1)-topos]] $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ over it is a [[totally âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to check that the [[fundamental âˆž-groupoid in a locally âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]]-functor $\Pi : Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C) \to \infty Grpd$ preserves [[finite limit|finite]] [[(âˆž,1)-limit]]s.

By the discussion at [[âˆž-connected site]] we have that $\Pi$ is given by the [[(âˆž,1)-colimit]] [[(âˆž,1)-functor]] $\lim_\to : Func(C^{op}, \infty Grpd) \to \infty Grpd$. On the [[opposite (âˆž,1)-category|opposite]] and therefore [[filtered (âˆž,1)-category]] $C^{op}$ these preserve finite [[(âˆž,1)-limit]]s.
