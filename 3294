## Idea

FrÃ©chet spaces are particularly well-behaved [[topological vector spaces]] (TVSes).  Every [[Cartesian space]] is a FrÃ©chet space, but there are also infinite-dimensional examples.  It is possible to do calculus on FrÃ©chet spaces, yet they are more general than [[Banach spaces]]; as such, they are popular as test spaces for possibly infinite-dimensional [[manifolds]]; see [[FrÃ©chet manifold]].

Note that a 'FrÃ©chet topology' on a 'FrÃ©chet topological space' is different; this just means that a [[topological space]] satisfies the $T_1$ [[separation axiom]].  (Like all Hausdorff TVSes, FrÃ©chet spaces satisfy this axiom, but they have a good deal of additional structure and properties.)


## Definition

A __FrÃ©chet space__ is a [[complete space|complete]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[locally convex space]] that is metrisable by a translation-invariant [[metric space|metric]].

Equivalently, a __FrÃ©chet space__ is a complete Hausdroff TVS whose topology may be given (as a [[gauge space]]) by a [[countable set|countable]] family of [[seminormed vector space|seminorms]].

We accept as an [[automorphism]] of FrÃ©chet spaces any linear [[homeomorphism]]; in particular, the particular translation-invariant metric or countable family of seminorms used to prove that a space is a FrÃ©chet space is *not* required to be preserved.  More generally, the [[morphisms]] of FrÃ©chet spaces are the [[continuous map|continuous]] linear maps, so that FrÃ©chet spaces form a [[full subcategory]] of $TVS$.


## Examples

Every [[Banach space]] is a FrÃ©chet space.

If $X$ is a [[compact space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]], then the space of [[smooth map|smooth maps]] on $X$ is a FrÃ©chet space.  This can be extended to some non-compact manifolds, in particular when $X$ is the [[real line]].

The [[Lebesgue space]] $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ for p &lt; 1 is *not* a FrÃ©chet space, because it is not locally convex.

## Properties
FrÃ©chet spaces are [[barrelled]] and [[bornological]]. 

The dual of a FrÃ©chet space $F$ is a FrÃ©chet space iff $F$ is a [[Banach space]].

Reference: This follows from the statement paragraph 29.1 (7) in Gottfried Koethe: _Topological Vector Spaces I_, which is: The strong dual of a locally convex metrizable TVS $F$ is metrizable iff $F$ is normable.

## Calculus
It is possible to generalize some aspects of calculus to FrÃ©chet spaces, for example the definition of the derivative of a curve is simply the same as in finite dimensions:


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
For a continuous path in a FrÃ©chet space $f(t)$ we define
$$
f'(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1}{h} (f(t + h) - f(t))
$$
If the limit exists and is continous, we say that $f$ is continuously differentiably or $C^1$.
=--

And just as in the finite dimensional case, we can define the partial derivative, or rather: the directional derivative:

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
**directional derivative**

Let F and G be FrÃ©chet spaces, $U \subseteq F$ open and $P: U \to G$ a nonlinear continuous map. The derivative of P at the point $f \in U$ in the direction $h \in F$ is the map
$$
DP: U \times F \to G
$$
$$
DP(f) h = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{1}{t} ( P(f + t h) - P(f))
$$
If the limit exists and is jointly continuous in both variables we say that $P$ is continuous differentiable or $C^1$.
=--

A simple, but nontrivial example is the operator 
$$
P: C^{\infty}[a, b] \to C^{\infty}[a, b]
$$
$$
P(f) := ff'
$$
with the derivative
$$
DP(f) h = f'h + fh'
$$

It is possible to generalize the Riemann integral to FrÃ©chet spaces, too: For a continuous path $f(t)$ on an interval $[a, b]$ in a FrÃ©chet space $F$ we look for an element $\int_a^b f(t) d t \in F$. It turns out that such an element exists and is unique, if we impose some properties of the integral known from the finite dimensional case:


+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
There exists a unique element $\int_a^b f(t) d t \in F$ such that

(i) for every continuous functional $\phi$ we have  $\phi(\int_a^b f(t) d t) = \int_a^b \phi(f(t)) d t$,

(ii) for every continuous seminorm $\| \cdot \|$ we have $\| \int_a^b f(t) d t \| \leq \int_a^b \| f(t) \| d t$

(iii) integration is linear and 

(iv) additive, i.e. $ \int_a^b f(t) d t + \int_b^c f(t) d t = \int_a^c f(t) d t $

=--

There is a version of the fundamental theorem of calculus:


+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
If P is $C^1$ and $f + t h \in Domain(P)$ for $0 \lt t \lt 1$, then 
$$
P(f + h) - P(f) = \int_0^1 DP(f + t h) \;h \; d t
$$

=--

The chain rule is valid:

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
If P and Q are $C^1$ then so is their composition $Q \circ P$ and
$$
D [Q \circ P](f) h = DQ(P(f)) \; DP(f) h
$$
=--
