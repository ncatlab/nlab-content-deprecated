## Idea

The generalization to the context of [[(âˆž,1)-category]]-theory of the notion of a [[full and faithful functor]] in ordinary [[category theory]].


## Definition

An [[(âˆž,1)-functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **full and faithful** if for all objects $x,y \in C$  it induced an equivalence on the [[hom-object in a quasi-category|hom-âˆž-groupoids]]

$$
  F_{x,y} : Hom_C(x,y) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
   Hom_D(F(x), F(y))
  \,.
$$

A full and faithful $(\infty,1)$-functor $F : C \to D$ exhibits $C$ as a [[full sub-(âˆž,1)-category]] of $D$ and one tends to write

$$
  F : C \hookrightarrow D
$$

to indicate this.


## Properties

A full and faithful $(\infty,1)$-functor is precisely a [[monomorphism in an (âˆž,1)-category|monomorphism]] in [[(âˆž,1)Cat]], hence a [[truncated object in an (âˆž,1)-category|(-1)-truncated]] morphism.

An [[(âˆž,1)-functor]] which is both full and faithful as well as an [[essentially surjective (âˆž,1)-functor]] is an [[equivalence of (âˆž,1)-categories]].
