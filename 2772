## Idea ##

The generalization to the context of [[(âˆž,1)-category]]-theory of the notion of a [[full and faithful functor]] in ordinary [[category theory]].

## Definition ##

An [[(âˆž,1)-functor]] $F : C \to D$ is full and faithful if regarded as an [[enriched functor]] of [[SSet]]-[[enriched category|enriched categories]] (see [[(âˆž,1)-category]] for this model) it has the property that for all pairs $x,y$ of objects in $C$ we have that

$$
  F_{x,y} : C(x,y) \to D(F(x), F(y))
$$

is a weak equivalence in the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]].
