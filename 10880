## Idea

A _WirthmÃ¼ller context_ is a pair of two [[symmetric monoidal categories]] which are connected by an [[adjoint triple]] of [[functors]] such that the middle one is a [[closed monoidal functor]].

This is a special case of the [[six operations]]. From this perspective the adjoint triple is traditionally written

$$
  f_! \dashv (f^! = f^\ast) \dashv f_\ast
  \,.
$$
