## Idea

The statement of the [[Yoneda lemma]] has a straightforward generalization from [[category|categories]] to [[(âˆž,1)-category|(âˆž,1)-categories]].

Following these [answers on MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/9737/the-yoneda-lemma-for-oo-1-categories), the full $(\infty,1)$-statement obtained this way holds.

One aspect of the generalization of the standard [[Yoneda lemma]], the fact that the [[Yoneda embedding]] is a [[full and faithful functor]], is known in the published literature to generalize.

###### Theorem
**$(\infty,1)$-Yoneda embedding**

Let $C$ be an [[(âˆž,1)-category]] and $PSh(C) := Func(C^\op, \infty Grpd)$ be the corresponding [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-presheaves]]. Then the canonical [[(âˆž,1)-functor]]

$$
  Y : C \to PSh(C) 
$$

is a [[full and faithful (âˆž,1)-functor]].
