The statement of the [[Yoneda lemma]] has a straightforward generalization from [[category|categories]] to [[(âˆž,1)-category|(âˆž,1)-categories]].

But it is not clear if it is known if the full $(\infty,1)$-statement obtained this way does hold.

But one aspect of the generalization of the standard [[Yoneda lemma]], the fact that the [[Yoneda embedding]] is a [[full and faithful functor]] is known to generalize.

###### Theorem
**$(\infty,1)$-Yoneda embedding**

Let $C$ be an [[(âˆž,1)-category]] and $PSh(C) := Func(C^\op, \infty Grpd)$ be the corresponding [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-presheaves]]. Then the canonical [[(âˆž,1)-functor]]

$$
  Y : C \to PSh(C) 
$$

is a [[full and faithful (âˆž,1)-functor]].
