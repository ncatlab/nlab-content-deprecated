## Idea

The statement of the [[Yoneda lemma]] has a straightforward generalization from [[category|categories]] to [[(âˆž,1)-category|(âˆž,1)-categories]].


## Details

###### Theorem
**$(\infty,1)$-Yoneda embedding**

Let $C$ be an [[(âˆž,1)-category]] and $PSh(C) := Func(C^\op, \infty Grpd)$ be the corresponding [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-presheaves]]. Then the canonical [[(âˆž,1)-functor]]

$$
  Y : C \to PSh(C) 
$$

is a [[full and faithful (âˆž,1)-functor]].

###### Proof

In terms of [[quasi-categories]], this is proposition 5.1.3.1 in

###### Theorem
**$(\infty,1)$-Yoneda theorem**

For $C$ a small $(\infty,1)$-category and $F : C^{op} \to \infty Grpd$ an $(\infty,1)$-functor, the composite

$$
  C^{op} \to PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C)^{op} \stackrel{Hom(-,F)}{\to}
  \infty Grpd
$$

is equivalent to $F$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This appears as [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT Lemma 5.5.2.1]].

The statement is a direct consequence of the [[sSet]]-[[enriched category theory|enriched]] [[Yoneda lemma]] by using the fact that the [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-presheaves]] $PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ is modeled by the [[enriched functor category]] $[C^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$ with $C$ regarded as a [[simplicially enriched category]] and using the global [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]].
