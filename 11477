## Idea

Topological AndrÃ©-Quillen homology is to [[A-âˆž algebras]] as [[KÃ¤hler differentials]] are to [[associative algebra]].

## Related concepts

* [[AndrÃ©-Quillen homology]]

* [[topological Hochschild homology]]

## References

The definition is recalled for instance in section 2 of

which otherwise proves the analog of the [[Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem]] in this context.
