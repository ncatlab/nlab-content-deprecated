## Idea

A *strongly connected site* is a [[site]] satisfying sufficient conditions to make its [[topos of sheaves]] into a [[strongly connected topos]].


## Definition

Let $C$ be a [[locally connected site]]; we say it is a **strongly connected site** it it is also a [[cosifted category]]


## Properties


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

If $C$ is strongly connected site, then the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(C)$ is a [[strongly connected topos]]. 

=--

Because the left adjoint $\Pi_0$ in the [[sheaf topos]] over a [[locally connected site]] is given by the [[colimit]] functor and colimits preserve finite [[product]]s on the [[sifted category]] $C^{op}$.
