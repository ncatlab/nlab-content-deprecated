## Generalised Cohomology Theories ##

The KÃ¼nneth theorem for [[generalised cohomology theories]] is a special case of the [[universal coefficient theorem]].  Let $E$ be a [[ring spectrum]], $X$ and $Y$ two [[spectra]].  Then we define a new [[cohomology theory]] as the $E$-[[module spectrum]] $G \coloneqq F(Y, E)$ where $F(-,-)$ is the [[function spectrum]] (that is, the [[internal hom]] in the category of [[spectra]]).  The ([[reduced cohomology|reduced]]) cohomology of $X$ in this cohomology theory is thus given by:

$$
G^*(X) = [X,F(Y,E)] = [X \wedge Y,E] = E^*(X \wedge Y)
$$

A [[universal coefficient theorem]] gives a way of computing $G^*(X)$ from knowledge of $E^*(X)$ and $G^*(pt)$.  In this case, $G^*(pt) = E^*(Y)$ so our initial data is $E^*(X)$ and $E^*(Y)$.

For more details, see the page on the [[universal coefficient theorem]].
