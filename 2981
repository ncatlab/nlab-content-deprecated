[[Arne Strom|Arne StrÃ¸m]] has proven that the category [[Top]] of *all* topological spaces has a structure of a Quillen [[model category]] where fibrations are [[Hurewicz fibrations]], cofibrations are closed [[Hurewicz cofibrations]] and the role of weak equivalences is played by (strong) [[homotopy equivalences]]. The theorem might have been a folklore at the time, but the actual paper has a number of subtleties.

StrÃ¸m's proofs are not that well-known today and use techniques better known to the topologists of that time, and there is consequently a slight controversy among topologists now. One of these is that there are modern reproofs, but these modern techniques essentially use the [[compactly generated space|compactly generated]] [[Hausdorff spaces]], while StrÃ¸m's proofs succeeded in avoiding that assumption.
