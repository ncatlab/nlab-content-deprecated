## Idea

A variant of the [[Ã©tale site]] where the finitess conditions on the [[fibers]] of [[Ã©tale morphisms]] is relaxed to a 
[[pro-object|pro-]]finitenss condition.

The [[sheaf topos]] over the pro-Ã©tale site might by called the pro-[[Ã©tale topos]].

The resulting [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] -- _pro Ã©tale cohomology_ -- has a good relation to [[â„“-adic cohomology]].

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[scheme]], its _pro Ã©tale site_ $X_{proet}$ is the [[site]]
whose [[objects]] are [[pro-Ã©tale morphisms]] into $X$ and whose [[Grothendieck topology]] is that of the [[fpqc site]].

## Properties

### In terms of weakly Ã©tale maps

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[morphism]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ of [[schemes]]
is called _weakly Ã©tale_ if 

1. $f$ is a [[flat morphism of schemes]];

1. its [[diagonal]] $X \longrightarrow X \times_Y X$ is also flat.

###### Definition

For $X$ a [[scheme]], its _pro Ã©tale site_ $X_{proet}$ is the [[site]]
whose [[objects]] are [[weakly Ã©tale morphisms]] into $X$ (hence weakly Ã©tale $X$-schemes) and whose [[Grothendieck topology]] is that of the [[fpqc site]].

### Relation to the Ã©tale topos


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Since every [[Ã©tale morphism of schemes]] is in particular a [[pro-Ã©tale morphism of schemes|pro Ã©tale morphism]], there is induced a [[geometric morphism]]

$$
  \nu
  \;\colo\;
  Sh(X_{proet})
  \longrightarrow
  Sh(X_{et})
$$

from the [[pro-Ã©tale topos]] to the [[Ã©tale topos]] of any [[scheme]] $X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

$\nu$ is a [[surjective geometric morphism]] with [[full and faithful functor|fully faithful]] [[inverse image]]. Hence the ordinary [[Ã©tale topos]] is a [[coreflective subcategory|coreflection]] of the pro-Ã©tale topos.
