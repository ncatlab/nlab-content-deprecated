## Idea

A variant of the [[Ã©tale site]] where the finitess conditions on [[Ã©tale morphisms]] are relaxed.

The resulting [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] -- _prop Ã©tale cohomology_ -- has a good relation to [[â„“-adic cohomology]].

## References

The pro-Ã©tale topology was suggested by Scholze and then fully developed in
