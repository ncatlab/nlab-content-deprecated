## Idea

A variant of the [[Ã©tale site]] where the finitess conditions on [[Ã©tale morphisms]] are relaxed.

The resulting [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] -- _pro Ã©tale cohomology_ -- has a good relation to [[â„“-adic cohomology]].

## Definition

###### Definition

A [[morphism]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ of [[schemes]]
is called _weakly Ã©tale_ if 

1. $f$ is a [[flat morphism of schemes]];

1. its [[diagonal]] $X \longrightarrow X \times_Y X$ is also flat.

###### Definition

For $X$ a [[scheme]], its _pro Ã©tale site_ $X_{proet}$ is the [[site]]
whose [[objects]] are [[weakly Ã©tale morphisms]] into $X$ (hence weakly Ã©tale $X$-schemes) and whose [[Grothendieck topology]] is that of the [[fpqc site]].

## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Every [[weakly Ã©tale morphism]] is a [[formally Ã©tale morphism]].

###### Corollary

A [[weakly Ã©tale morphism]] which is [[locally of finite presentation]] is an [[Ã©tale morphism of schemes|Ã©tale morphism]].
