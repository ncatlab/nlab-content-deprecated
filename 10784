## Idea

The _pro-Ã©tale site_ is a variant of the [[Ã©tale site]] where the finiteness conditions on the [[fibers]] of [[Ã©tale morphisms of schemes|Ã©tale morphisms]] is relaxed to a 
[[pro-object|pro-]]finiteness condition ([[pro-Ã©tale morphism of schemes|pro-Ã©tale morphisms]])

The [[sheaf topos]] over the pro-Ã©tale site might by called the _pro-[[Ã©tale topos]]_. Its [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] -- _pro Ã©tale cohomology_ -- improves on that of the original [[Ã©tale topos]] in that it genuinely contains ([Bhatt-Scholze 13](#BhattScholze13)) the [[Weil cohomology theory]] called [[â„“-adic cohomology]] (while over the [[Ã©tale site]] this is only given by an [[inverse limit]] of [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]).

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[scheme]], its _pro Ã©tale site_ $X_{proet}$ is the [[site]]
whose [[objects]] are [[pro-Ã©tale morphisms]] into $X$ and whose [[Grothendieck topology]] is that of the [[fpqc site]].

## Properties

### In terms of weakly Ã©tale maps

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[morphism]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ of [[schemes]]
is called _weakly Ã©tale_ if 

1. $f$ is a [[flat morphism of schemes]];

1. its [[diagonal]] $X \longrightarrow X \times_Y X$ is also flat.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[scheme]], its _pro Ã©tale site_ $X_{proet}$ is the [[site]]
whose [[objects]] are [[weakly Ã©tale morphisms]] into $X$ (hence weakly Ã©tale $X$-schemes) and whose [[Grothendieck topology]] is that of the [[fpqc site]].

([Bhatt-Scholze 13, def. 4.1.1](#BhattScholze13))

### Generation by w-contractible rings

+-- {: .num_defn #wContractible}
###### Definition

A [[commutative ring]] $R$ is a **[[w-contractible ring]]** if every [[faithfully flat morphism|faithfully flat]] [[pro-Ã©tale morphism]] $Spec A \to Spec R$ has a [[section]].

=--

([Bhatt-Scholze 13, def. 2.4.1](#BhattScholze13))

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For every [[commutative ring]] $R$, there is a a w-contractible $A$, def. \ref{wContractible},
equipped with a [[faithfully flat morphism|faithfully flat]] [[pro-Ã©tale morphism]] $Spec A \to Spec R$.

=--

([Bhatt-Scholze 13, lemma 2.4.9](#BhattScholze13))

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

So the [[full subcategory]] on the [[w-contractible rings]] forms a [[dense subsite]] of the pro-Ã©tale site, consisting of objects with pro-[[Ã©tale homotopy type]] a set.

=--

### Relation to the Ã©tale topos


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Since every [[Ã©tale morphism of schemes]] is in particular a [[pro-Ã©tale morphism of schemes|pro Ã©tale morphism]], there is induced a [[geometric morphism]]

$$
  \nu
  \;\colon\;
  Sh(X_{proet})
  \longrightarrow
  Sh(X_{et})
$$

from the [[pro-Ã©tale topos]] to the [[Ã©tale topos]] of any [[scheme]] $X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

$\nu$ is a [[surjective geometric morphism]] with [[full and faithful functor|fully faithful]] [[inverse image]]. Hence the ordinary [[Ã©tale topos]] is a [[coreflective subcategory|coreflection]] of the pro-Ã©tale topos.

=--

([Bhatt-Scholze 13, lemma 5.1.2](#BhattScholze13))


## Examples

Given a [[field]] $k$ with [[separable closure]] $\overline{k}$, then the pro-etale site of $Spec(\overline{k})$ is equivalently the category of [[profinite sets]]. The pro-etale site of $Spec(k)$ identifies with the category of profinite continuous $G$-sets. ([Bhatt-Scholze 13, example 4.1.10](#BhattScholze13)).
