An [[âˆž-stack]] on a [[(âˆž,1)-category]]-domain $C$ that happens to be an ordinary [[category]] (i.e. not a [[derived stack]]) is **rectified** if it is an ordinary [[functor]]
$
 C^{op} \to  $ [[SSet]] instead of a general [[(âˆž,1)-functor]] (i.e. [[pseudofunctor]]).

A central theorem about the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] says that rectified [[âˆž-stack]]s are _sufficient_: they already [[presentable (âˆž,1)-category|present]] the full [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-sheaves]] (= [[âˆž-stacks]]).

Notice that, by a result recalled at [[descent for simplicial presheaves]], a rectified $\infty$-stack $A$ is an [[âˆž-groupoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] (pre)sheaves satisfying a [[descent]] condition.
