## Idea ##

Traditional _Ã©tale cohomology_ (e.g. [Deligne 77](#Deligne77)) is the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] for [[sheaf|sheaves]] on the [[Ã©tale site]] of a [[scheme]] -- which is an analog of the [[category of open subsets]] of a [[topological space]] $X$ , or rather the analog of the category of [[Ã©tale spaces]] over $X$, with [[finite set|finite]] [[fibers]].

A certain [[inverse limit]] over Ã©tale cohomology groups for different [[coefficients]] yields [[â„“-adic cohomology]], which is a [[Weil cohomology theory]].

More generally, there is Ã©tale [[generalized cohomology theory]] with [[coefficients]] in [[sheaves of spectra]] on the [[Ã©tale site]] ([Jardine 97](#Jardine97)). Still more generally, there is Ã©tale generalized cohomology on the [[Ã©tale (âˆž,1)-site]] ([Antieau-Gepner 12](#AntieauGepner12), [Lurie](#Lurie)).



## Definition ##

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition


Given a [[scheme]] $X$ of finite type, the small [[Ã©tale site]] $X_{et}$ is the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[Ã©tale morphisms]] $Spec R \to X$ and whose morphisms $(f:Spec R\to X)\to (f':Spec R'\to X)$ are morphisms $\alpha: Spec(R)\to Spec(R')$ of schemes completing triangles: $f'\circ\alpha=f$ (notice that the morphisms between Ã©tale morphisms are automatically Ã©tale). This category naturally carries a [[Grothendieck topology]] that makes it a [[site]], the [[Ã©tale site]].

For $A \in Sh(X_{et}, Ab)$ an [[abelian sheaf]] on $X$, the **Ã©tale cohomology** $H_{et}^\bullet(X,A)$ of $X$ with [[coefficients]] in $A$  is the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with respect to this site.

## Basic properties
 {#BasicProperties}

The following are some basic properties of Ã©tale [[cohomology groups]] for various standard choices of [[coefficients]]. 

### Relation to Zariski cohomology 
 {#RelationZariskiEtaleCohomology}

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

A [[cover]] in the [[Zariski topology]] on [[schemes]] is an [[open immersion of schemes]] and hence is in particular an [[Ã©tale morphism of schemes]]. Hence the [[Ã©tale site]] is finer than the [[Zariski site]] and so every Ã©tale [[sheaf]] is a Zarsiki sheaf, but not necessarily conversely. 

=--



+-- {: .num_remark #LerayForInclusionOfZariskiIntoEtale}
###### Remark

For $X$ a [[scheme]], the inclusion

$$
  \epsilon \;\colon\; X_{Zar} \longrightarrow X_{et}
$$

of the [[Zariski site]] into the [[Ã©tale site]] is indeed a [[morphism of sites]]. Hence there is a [[Leray spectral sequence]] which computes Ã©tale cohomology in terms of Zarsiki cohomology 

$$
  E^{p,q}_2 = H^p(X_{Zar}, R^q \epsilon^\ast \mathcal{F})
  \Rightarrow
  E^{p+q} = H^{p+q}(X_{et}, \mathcal{F})
  \,.
$$

=--

This is originally due to ([[Grothendieck]], [[SGA]] 4 (Chapter VII, p355)). Reviews include ([Tamme, II 1.3](#Tamme)).


### With coefficients in coherent modules
 {#WithCoefficientsInCoherentModules}

+-- {: .num_prop #CohomologyWithCoeffsInCoherentModules}
###### Proposition

For $N$ a [[quasi-coherent sheaf]] of $\mathcal{O}_X$-[[modules]] and $N_{et}$ the induced Ã©tale sheaf (by the discussion at [Ã©tale topos -- Quasicohetent sheaves](etale+topos#QuasiCoherentModules)),
then the [[edge morphism]]

$$
  H^p_{Zar}(X, N)
  \longrightarrow
  H^p_{et}(X,N_{et})
$$

of the [[Leray spectral sequence]] of remark \ref{LerayForInclusionOfZariskiIntoEtale} is an  [[isomorphism]] for all $p$, itentifying the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] on the [[Zariski site]] with [[coefficients]] in $N$ with the Ã©tale cohomology with coefficients in $N_{et}$.

Moreover, for $X$ affine we have

$$
  H^p_{et}(X, N_{et}) \simeq 0
  \,.
$$


=--

This is due to ([[Grothendieck]], [[FGA]] 1). See also for instance ([Tamme, II (4.1.2)](#Tamme)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the discussion at _[[edge morphism]]_ it suffices to show that 

$$
  R^q \epsilon_\ast (N) = 0 \;\,,\;\;\; for \;\; p \gt 0
  \,.
$$

By the discussion at _[[direct image]]_ (also at _[[abelian sheaf cohomology]]_), $R^q \epsilon_\ast N$ is the [[sheaf]] on the [[Zariski topology]] which is the [[sheafification]] of the [[presheaf]] given by

$$
  U \mapsto H^q(X_{et}|U, N)
  \,,
$$

hence it is sufficient that this vanishes, or rather, by locality ([[sheafification]]) it suffices to show this vanishes for $X = U = Spec(A)$ an affine [[algebraic variety]].

By the existence of [cofinal affine Ã©tale covers](etale+site#CofinalAffineCovers) the [[full subcategory]] $X_{et}^{a} \hookrightarrow X_{at}$ with the induced [[coverage]] is a [[dense subsite]] of affines. Therefore it suffices to show the statement there. 
Moreover, by the finiteness condition on [[Ã©tale morphisms]]  every cover of $X_{et}^{a}$ may be refined by a finite cover, hence by an affine covering map 

$$
  Spec(B) \longrightarrow Spec(A)
  \,.
$$

It follows (by a discussion such as e.g. at [[Sweedler coring]]) that the corresponding [[Cech cohomology]] complex

$$
  N_{et}(Spec(A)) \to C^0(\{Spec(B) \to Spec(A)\}, N_{et}) \to C^1(\{Spec(B) \to Spec(A)\}, N_{et}) \to \cdots
$$

is of the form

$$
  0 \to N \to N \otimes_A B \to N \otimes_{A} B \otimes_A B \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

known as the [[Amitsur complex]].

Since $A \to B$ is a [[faithfully flat morphism]] it follows by the [[descent theorem]] that this is [[exact sequence|exact]], hence that the cohomology indeed vanishes.

### With coefficients in a cyclic group
 {#WithCoefficientsInACyclicGroup}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

If $X = Spec(A)$ is an affine [[reduced scheme]] of [[characteristic]] a [[prime number]] $p$, then its [[Ã©tale cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is

$$
  H^q(X, (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})_X)
  \simeq
  \left\{
    \array{
      A/(F - id)A & if\; q = 1
      \\
      0 & if \; q \gt 0
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Under the given assumptions, the [[Artin-Schreier sequence]] (see there) induces a [[long exact sequence in cohomology]] of the form

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    0 & \to 
    H^0(X_{et}, \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}) \to H^0(X_{et}, \mathcal{O}_X) \stackrel{F-id}{\to} H^0(X_{et}, \mathcal{O}_X)
   \\
    & \to
     H^1(X_{et}, \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}) \to H^1(X_{et}, \mathcal{O}_X) \stackrel{F-id}{\to} H^1(X_{et}, \mathcal{O}_X)
   \\
    & \to
     H^2(X_{et}, \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}) \to H^2(X_{et}, \mathcal{O}_X) \stackrel{F-id}{\to} H^2(X_{et}, \mathcal{O}_X) \to \cdots
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where $F(-) = (-)^p$ is the [[Frobenius endomorphism]]. 
By prop. \ref{CohomologyWithCoeffsInCoherentModules}
the terms of the form $H^{p \geq 1}(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ vanish,
and so from [[exact sequence|exactness]] we find an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  H^0(X_{et}, \mathcal{O}_X)/(F-id)(H^0(X_{et}, \mathcal{O}_X))
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  H^1(X_{et}, \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})
  \,,
$$

hence the claimed isomorphism

$$
  A/(F-id)(A)
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  H^1(X_{et}, \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})
  \,.
$$

By the same argument all the higher cohomology groups vanish, as claimed.

### With coefficients in the multiplicative group

the Ã©tale cohomology groups with [[coefficients]] in the [[multiplicative group]] $\mathbb{G}_m$ in the first few degrees go by special names:

* $H^0_{et}(-, \mathbb{G}_m)$: [[group of units]];

* $H^1_{et}(-, \mathbb{G}_m)$: [[Picard group]] ([[Hilbert's theorem 90], [Tamme, II 4.3.1](#Tamme));

* $H^2_{et}(-, \mathbb{G}_m)$: [[Brauer group]];


### With coefficients in groups of roots of unity

Ã‰tale cohomology was conceived by [[Artin]], [[Deligne]], [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]] and [[Verdier]] in 1963. It was used by Deligne to prove the [[Weil conjectures]]. Some useful (and also funny) remarks on this are in the beginning of
