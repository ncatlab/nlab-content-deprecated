## Definition

In [[coarse geometry]], a _coarse structure_ on a [[set]]Â $X$ is a [[subset]] $C\subset P(X\times X)$ (of the [[power set]] of the [[Cartesian product]] of $X$ with itself)  that contains the [[diagonal]] ofÂ $X$ and is closed under finite [[unions]], subsets, compositions, and inverses. (Here composition is given by the [[fiber product]] overÂ $X$, whereas inverses are obtained by permuting the two factors ofÂ $X$.)

The elements ofÂ $C$ are called _entourages_ or _controlled subsets_.
