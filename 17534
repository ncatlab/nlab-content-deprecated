## Definition

In [[coarse geometry]], a coarse structure on a setÂ $X$
is a subset $C\subset P(X\times X)$ that contains the diagonal ofÂ $X$ and is closed under finite
unions, subsets, compositions, and inverses.
(Composition is given by the fiber product overÂ $X$,
whereas inverses are obtained by permuting the two factors ofÂ $X$.)

The elements ofÂ $C$ are called _entourages_ or _controlled subsets_.
