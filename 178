
## Idea

A Lie $\infty$-groupoid is supposed to be an [[âˆž-groupoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] a suitable category of [[generalized smooth spaces]]; see [[internal âˆž-groupoid]]. 

Following the general idea of [[space and quantity]] and [[generalized smooth space]]s one may identify smooth $\infty$-groupoids with [[smooth infinity-stack]]s.

But notice that the traditional notion called [[Lie groupoid]] is more restritive than a 1-coskeletal [[smooth âˆž-stack]].

The details usually depend on which aspect of higher [[Lie theory]] one wants to capture.

A systematic setup is proposed at [[schreiber:âˆž-Lie theory]].
