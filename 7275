## Idea

An ordinary [[group]] is either an [[abelian group]] or not. For an [[âˆž-group]] there is an infinite tower of notions ranging from completely non-abelian to completely abelian. An _abelian âˆž-group_ is one which is maximally abelian. This is equivalently a [[connective spectrum object]].

## Examples

* A [[0-truncated]] abelian $\infty$-group is equivalently an [[abelian group]].

* A [[1-truncated]] abelian $\infty$-group is equivalently a [[symmetric 2-group]].

* A [[2-truncated]] abelian $\infty$-group is equivalently a [[symmetric 3-group]].
