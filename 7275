## Idea

An ordinary [[group]] is either an [[abelian group]] or not. For an [[âˆž-group]] there is an infinite tower of notions ranging from completely non-abelian to completely abelian. An _abelian âˆž-group_ is one which is maximally abelian. This is equivalently a [[connective spectrum object]].
