## Idea

A _smooth super $\infty$-groupoid_ is an [[âˆž-groupoid]] equiped with [[cohesive (âˆž,1)-topos|cohesion]] in the form of [[supermanifold]]-structure.

## Definition

Let [[CartSp]]${}_{super}$ be the [[site]] of [[supermanifold]] of the form $\mathbb{R}^{p|q}$ and smooth superfunctions between them, equipped with the [[coverage]] of [[good open cover]]s.

This is a [[âˆž-cohesive site]], by the same argument as [[CartSp]]${}_{synthdiff}$ is.

The [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] of **super smooth âˆž-groupoids** is the [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-sheaves]]

$$
 SSmooth\infty Grpd := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{super})
 \,.
$$

## Properties

This is a [[cohesive (âˆž,1)-topos]]. It is an <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive%20(infinity,1)-topos#structures_in_the_presence_of_infinitesimal_cohesion_149">infinitesimal thickening</a> of [[SmoothâˆžGrpd]]. As such it is similar to [[SynthDiffâˆžGrpd]] but differs subtly from it. Both are unified in the $(\infty,1)$-topos [[SSynthDiffâˆžGrpd]] of _super synthetic differential $\infty$-groupoids_
