## Definition

A [[locally âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]] 

$$
  (\Pi \dashv \Delta \dashv \Gamma) : \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd
$$ 

is called **strongly connected** if $\Pi$ preserves [[finite limit|finite]] [[(âˆž,1)-product]]s (hence in particular the [[terminal object]], which makes it also an [[âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]]). 

Similarly for an $n$-connected $(n,1)$-topos.

For $n = 1$ this yields the notion of [[strongly connected topos]].

If in addition $\mathbf{H}$ is a [[local (âˆž,1)-topos]] then it is a [[cohesive (âˆž,1)-topos]].
