## Idea

Given a [[category]] $C$,
suppose $I$ is a [[set]] and $D_i\colon K_i\to C$
is a [[diagram]] in $C$ for each $i\in I$.
Denote by $E\colon\prod_i K_i\to C$ the diagram
obtained by composing the [[product]] of diagrams $\prod_i D_i: \prod_i K_i \to C^I$ with the product functor $C^I\to C$.
We have a canonical comparison [[morphism]] $colim E \to \prod_i colim D_i$.
[[colimit|Colimits]] inÂ $C$ _distribute over products_ if the comparison morphism is always an [[isomorphism]].

## In sets

In the category [[Set]] of sets [[filtered colimits]] distribute over small [[products]]
and small colimits distribute over [[finite products]].
However, [[reflexive coequalizers]] or [[sifted colimits]] do not distribute over infinite products. See ExampleÂ 3.20 inÂ [ARV](#ARV).

## In algebraic categories

In any [[algebraic category]], i.e., the category of algebras over a small algebraic theory, [[filtered colimits]] distribute over small products and sifted colimits distribute over finite products.
Generally speaking, small colimits do not distribute over finite products.
See CorollaryÂ 3.21 inÂ [ARV](#ARV).

## In algebraically exact categories

In any [[algebraically exact category]], in particular,
in any [[variety]], sifted colimits distribute over small limits,
i.e., the functor $colim: Sind(C)\to C$ is continuous,
see TheoremÂ 3.11.(3) in [ALRalg](#ALRalg).

## In locally finitely presentable categories

In any [[locally finitely presentable category]], equivalently the category of algebras
over some finitary [[essentially algebraic theory]], filtered colimits distribute over small products.
See TheoremÂ 5.13 and LemmaÂ 5.14 inÂ [ALR](#ALR).

## For more general types of limits than products

Filtered (or sifted) colimits distribute over a given class of limits in a categoryÂ $C$
if the canonical functor $Ind(C)\to C$ (or $Sind(C)\to C$) preserves this class of limits.
See DefinitionÂ 5.11 inÂ [ALR](#ALR).

Even more generally, one can prove
a distributivity theorem for any sound doctrineÂ $D$ of limits, see SectionÂ 6 in [ABLR](#ABLR).
