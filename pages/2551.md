##Idea

Given a [[site]] $C$ equipped with an [[interval object]] ${*}\amalg {*} \stackrel{[i_0, i_1]}{\to}I$ the **homotopy localization** of an [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-sheaves]] $Sh_\infty(C)$ on $C$ is the [[localization of an (âˆž,1)-category|(âˆž,1)-categorical localization]] of $Sh_\infty(C)$ at the morphisms of the form

$$
  X \times I \to X
  \,.
$$



##Examples

* Taking $C =$ [[Top]] and the [[interval object]] $I$ to be the standard topological interval $I = [0,1]$, the homotopy localization of $\infty$-stacks on $Top$ is equivalent to the [[(âˆž,1)-category]] [[Top]] itself again. For more on this see the discussion and references at [[topological âˆž-groupoid]].

* A homotopy localization of the [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] of [[âˆž-stack]]s on the [[Nisnevich site]] is used in [[motivic homotopy theory]]. See there for more details.
