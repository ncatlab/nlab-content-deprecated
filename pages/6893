## Idea

In ordinary [[topos theory]] it is common to "work over a fixed [[base topos]]" which may or may not be the canonical choice [[Set]].

Similarily, in [[(âˆž,1)-topos theory]] one may choose to work over a fixed _base $(\infty,1)$-topos_ $\mathbf{B}$ other than [[âˆžGrpd]].

Basically this amounts to working not with the [[(âˆž,1)-category]] [[(âˆž,1)Topos]], but instead in the [[over-(âˆž,1)-topos]] $(\infty,1)Topos/\mathbf{B}$.
