An [[equivalence in an (âˆž,1)-category]] in [[âˆžGrpd]], hence ann [[equivalence of (âˆž,1)-categories]] between [[(âˆž,1)-categories]] that happen to be [[âˆž-groupoids]].

In terms of presentation by [[topological spaces]] or [[simplicial sets]] (see at _[[homotopy hypothesis]]_) this is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]. 

In terms of presentation by [[CW-complexes]] or [[Kan complexes]], it is a [[homotopy equivalence]].
