__George PÃ³lya__ (December 13, 1888 â€“ September 7, 1985) was a Hungarian mathematician (natively: PÃ³lya GyÃ¶rgy) who worked in many fields of mathematics, including [[combinatorics]], analysis, probability and [[arithmetic]]. He was the author of a number of books on the heuristics of mathematical research, that is, methods to formulate and solve problems. Against the trend of considering mathematical reasoning to be wholly deductive, PÃ³lya wrote on analogical and [[inductive reasoning]] in mathematics. He was also writing about mathematics education.
