> Dies Beisichsein des Geistes, dies Zusichselbstkommen desselben kann als sein hÃ¶chstes, absolutes Ziel ausgesprochen werden. Nur dies will er, und nichts anderes. Alles, was im Himmel und auf Erden geschieht â€“ ewig geschieht â€“, das Leben Gottes und alles, was zeitlich getan wird, strebt nur danach hin, daÃŸ der Geist sich erkenne, sich selber gegenstÃ¤ndlich mache, sich finde, fÃ¼r sich selber werde, sich mit sich zusammenschlieÃŸe.

Ich behaupte, daÃŸ, wenn man die Grundbegriffe der in der Geschichte der Philosophie erschienenen Systeme rein dessen entkleidet, was ihre Ã¤uÃŸerliche Gestaltung, ihre Anwendung auf das Besondere und dergleichen betrifft, so erhÃ¤lt man die verschiedenen Stufen der Bestimmung der Idee selbst in ihrem logischen Begriffe.

> {#HegelHistory1} What specially characterizes Zeno is the [[dialectic]] which, properly speaking, begins with him; 

> he is the master of the Eleatic school in whom its pure thought arrives at the movement of the Notion in itself and becomes the pure soul of science. That is to say, in the Eleatics hitherto considered, we only have the proposition: â€œThe nothing has no reality and is not at all, and thus what is called origin and decease disappears.â€ With Zeno, on the contrary, we certainly see just such an assertion of the one and removal of what contradicts it, but we also see that this assertion is not made the starting point; for reason begins by calmly demonstrating in that which is established as existent, its negation. Parmenides asserts that â€œThe all is immutable, for, in change, the non-being of that which is would be asserted, but Being only is; in saying that â€œnon-being is, the subject and the predicate contradict themselves.â€ Zeno, on the other hand, says: â€œAssert your change; in it as change there is the negation to it, or it is nothing.â€ To the former change existed as motion, definite and complete. Zeno protested against motion as such, or pure motion.

> Pure Being is not motion; it is rather the negation of motion.â€ We find it specially interesting that there is in Zeno the higher consciousness, the consciousness that when one determination is denied, this negation is itself again a determination, and then in the absolute negation not one determination, but both the opposites must be negated. Zeno anticipated this, and because he foresaw that Being is the opposite of nothing, he denied of the One what must be said of the nothing. But the same thing must occur with all the rest. We find this higher dialectic in Platoâ€™s Parmenides; here it only breaks forth in respect to some determinations, and not to the determination of the One and of Being. The higher consciousness is the consciousness of the nullity of Being as of what is determined as against the nothing, partly found in Heraclitus and then in the Sophists; with them it never has any truth, it has no existence in itself, but is only the for-another, or the assurance of the individual consciousness, and assurance as refutation, i.e. the negative side, of dialectic.

> According to Diogenes LaÃ«rtius, (IX. 25) Zeno was like wise an Eleat; he is the youngest, and lived most in company with Parmenides. The latter became very fond of him and adopted him as a son; his own father was called Telentagoras. Not in his State alone was his conduct held in high respect, for his fame was universal, and he was esteemed particularly as a teacher. Plato mentions that men came to him from Athens and other places, in order to profit from his learning. Proud self-sufficiency is ascribed to him by Diogenes (IX. 28) because he â€” with the exception of a journey made to Athens â€” continued to reside in Elea, and did not stay a longer time in the great, mighty Athens, and there attain to fame. In very various narratives his death was made for ever celebrated for the strength of his mind evinced in it; it was said that he freed a State (whether his own home at Elea or in Sicily, is not known) from its Tyrant (the name is given differently, but an exact historical account has not been recorded) in the following way, and by the sacrifice of his life. He entered into a plot to overthrow the Tyrant, but this was betrayed. When the Tyrant now, in face of the people, caused him to be tortured in every possible way to get from him an avowal of his confederates, and when he questioned him about the enemies of the State, Zeno first named to the Tyrant all his friends as participators in the plot, and then spoke of the Tyrant himself as the pest of the State. The powerful remonstrances or the horrible tortures and death of Zeno aroused the citizens, inspired them with courage to fall upon the Tyrant, kill him, and liberate themselves. The manner of the end, and his violent and furious state of mind, is very variously depicted. He is said to have pretended to wish to say something into the Tyrantâ€™s ear, and then to have bitten his ear, and thus held him fast until lie was slain by the others. Others say that he seized him by the nose between his teeth; others that as on his reply great tortures were applied, he bit off his tongue and spat it into the Tyrantâ€™s face, to show him that he could get nothing from him, and that he then was pounded in a mortar.

> It has just been noticed that Zeno had the very important character of being the originator of the true objective dialectic. Xenophanes, Parmenides, and Melisibus, start with the proposition: â€œNothing is nothing; the nothing does not exist at all, or the like is real existence,â€ that is, they make one of the opposed predicates to be existence. Now when they encounter the opposite in a determination, they demolish this determination, but it is only demolished through another, through my assertion, through the distinction that I form, by which one side is made to be the true, and the other the null. We have proceeded from a definite proposition; the nullity of the opposite does not appear in itself; it is not that it abrogates itself, i.e. that it contains a contradiction in itself. For instance, I assert of something that it is the null; then I show this by hypothesis in motion, and it follows that it is the null. But another consciousness does not assert this I declare one thing to be directly true; another has the right of asserting something else as directly true, that is to say, motion. Similarly what seems to be the case when one philosophic system contradicts another, is that the first is pre-established, and that men starting from this point of view, combat the other. The matter is thus easily settled by saying: â€œThe other has no truth, because it does not agree with me,â€ and the other bas the right to say the same. It does not help if I prove my system or my proposition and then conclude that thus the opposite is false; to this other proposition the first always seems to be foreign and external. Falsity must not be demonstrated through another, and as untrue because the opposite is true, but in itself; we find this rational perception in Zeno.


> In Platoâ€™s [[Parmenides]] (pp. 127, 128, Steph., pp. 6, 7, Bekk.) this dialectic is very well described, for Plato makes Socrates say of it: â€œZeno in his writings asserts fundamentally the same as does Parmenides, that All is One, but he would feign delude us into believing that he was telling something new. Parmenides thus shows in his poems that All is One; Zeno, on the contrary, shows that the Many cannot be.â€ Zeno replies, that â€œHe wrote thus really against those who try to make Parmenidesâ€™ position ridiculous, for they try to show what absurdities and self-contradictions can be derived from his statements; he thus combats those who deduce Being from the many, in order to show that far more absurdities arise from this than from the statements of Parmenides.â€ That is the special aim of objective dialectic, in which we no longer maintain simple thought for itself, but see the battle fought with new vigour within the enemyâ€™s camp. Dialectic has in Zeno this negative side, but it bas also to be considered from its positive side.

> According to the ordinary ideas of science, where propositions result from proof, proof is the movement of intelligence, a connection brought about by mediation. Dialectic is either (a) external dialectic, in which this movement is different from the comprehension of the movement, or (b) not a movement of our intelligence only, but what proceeds from the nature of the thing itself, i.e. from the pure Notion of the content. The former is a manner of regarding. objects in such a way that reasons are revealed and new light thrown, by means of which all that was supposed to be firmly fixed, is made to totter; there may be reasons which are altogether external too, and we shall speak further of this dialectic when dealing with the Sophists. The other dialectic, however, is the immanent contemplation of the object; it is taken for itself, without previous hypothesis, idea or obligation, not under any outward conditions, laws or causes; we have to put ourselves right into the thing, to consider the object in itself, and to take it in the determinations which it has. In regarding it thus, it shows from itself that it contains opposed determinations, and thus breaks up; this dialectic we more especially find in the ancients. The subjective dialectic, which reasons from external grounds, is moderate, for it grants that: â€œIn the right there is what is not right, and in the false the true.â€ True dialectic leaves nothing whatever to its object, as if the latter were deficient on one side only; for it disintegrates itself in the entirety of its nature. The result of this dialectic is null, the negative; the affirmative in it does not yet appear. This true dialectic may be associated with the work of the Eleatics. But in their case the real meaning and quality of philosophic understanding was not great, for they got no further than the fact that through contradiction the object is a nothing.

> Zenoâ€™s dialectic of matter has not been refuted to the present day; even now we have not got beyond it, and the matter is left in uncertainty. Simplicius, writing on the Physics of [[Aristotle]] (p. 30), says: â€œZeno proves that if the many is, it must be great and small; if great, the many must be infinite in numberâ€ (it must have gone beyond the manifold, as indifferent limit, into the infinite; but what is infinite is no longer large. and no longer many, for it is the negation of the many). â€œIf small, it must be so small as to have no size,â€ like atoms. â€œHere he shows that what has neither size, thickness nor mass, cannot be. For if it were added to another, it would not cause its increase; were it, that is to say, to have no size and be added thereto, it could not supplement the size of the other and consequently that which is added is nothing. Similarly were it taken away, the other would not be made less, and thus it is nothing. If what has being is, each existence necessarily has size and thickness, is outside of one another, and one is separate from the other; the same applies to all else (peri tou proucontoÏ‚), for it, too, has size, and in it there is what mutually differs (proexei autou ti). But it is the same thing to say something once and to say it over and over again; in it nothing can be a last, nor will there not be another to the other. Thus if many are, they are small and great; small, so that they have no size; great, so that they are infinite.â€

> Aristotle (Phys. VI. 9) explains this dialectic further; Zenoâ€™s treatment of motion was above all objectively dialectical. But the particulars which we find in the [[Parmenides]] of [[Plato]] are not his. For Zenoâ€™s consciousness we see simple unmoved thought disappear, but become thinking movement; in that he combats sensuous movement, he concedes it. The reason that dialectic first fell on movement is that the dialectic is itself this movement, or movement itself the dialectic of all that is. The thing, as self-moving, has its dialectic in itself, and movement is the becoming another, self-abrogation. If Aristotle says that Zeno denied movement because it contains an inner contradiction, it is not to be understood to mean that movement did. not exist at all. The point is not that there is movement and that this phenomenon exists; the fact that there is movement is as sensuously certain as that there are elephants; it is not in this sense that Zeno meant to deny movement. The point in question concerns its truth. Movement, however, is held to be untrue, because the conception of it involves a contradiction; by that he meant to say that no true Being eau be predicated of it.

> Zenoâ€™s utterances are to be looked at from this point of view, not as being directed against the reality of motion, as would at first appear, but as pointing out how movement must necessarily be determined, and showing the course which must be taken. Zeno now brings forward four different arguments against motion; the proofs rest on the infinite divisibility of space and time.

> (a) This is his first form of argument: â€” â€œMovement has no truth, because what is in motion must first reach the middle of the space before arriving at the end.â€ Aristotle expresses this thus shortly, because he had earlier treated of and worked out the subject at length. This is to be taken as indicating generally that the continuity of space is pre-supposed. What moves itself must reach a certain, end, this way is a whole. In order to traverse the whole, what is in motion must first pass over the half, and now the end of this half is considered as being the end; but this half of space is again a whole, that which also has a half, and the half of this half must first have been reached, and so on into infinity. Zeno here arrives at the infinite divisibility of space; because space and time are absolutely continuous, there is no point at which the division can stop. Every dimension (and every time and space always have a dimension) is again divisible into two halves, which must be measured off; and however small a space we have, the same conditions reappear. Movement would be the act of passing through these infinite moments, and would therefore never end 4 thus what is in motion cannot reach its end. It is known how Diogenes of Sinope, the Cynic, quite simply refuted these arguments against movement; without speaking he rose and walked about, contradicting them by action. But when reasons are disputed, the only valid refutation is one derived from reasons; men have not merely to satisfy themselves by sensuous assurance, but also to understand. To refute objections is to prove their non-existence, as when they are made to fall away and can hence be adduced no longer; but it is necessary to think of motion as Zeno thought of it, and yet to carry this theory of motion further still.

> We have here the spurious infinite or pure appearance, whose simple principle Philosophy demonstrates as universal Notion, for the first time making its appearance as developed in its contradiction; in the history of Philosophy a consciousness of this contradiction is also attained. Movement, this pure phenomenon, appears as something thought and shown forth in its real being â€” that is, in its distinction of pure self-identity and pure negativity, the point as distinguished from continuity. To us there is no contradiction in the idea that the here of space and the now of time are considered as a continuity and length; but their Notion is self-contradictory. Self-identity or continuity is absolute cohesion, the destruction of all difference, of all negation, of being for self; the point, on the contrary, is pure being-for-self, absolute self-distinction and the destruction of all identity and all connection with what is different. Both of these, however, are, in space and time, placed in one; space and time are thus the contradiction; it is necessary, first of all, to show the contradiction in movement, for in movement that which is opposed is, to ordinary conceptions, inevitably manifested. Movement is just the reality of time and space, and because this appears and is made manifest, the apparent contradiction is demonstrated, a and it is this contradiction that Zeno notices. The limitation of bisection which is involved in the continuity of space, is not absolute limitation, for that which is limited is again continuity; however, this continuity is again not absolute, for the opposite has to be exhibited in it, the limitation of bisection; but the limitation of continuity is still not thereby established, the half is still continuous, and so on into infinity. In that we say â€œinto infinity,â€ we place before ourselves a beyond, outside of the ordinary conception, which cannot reach so far. It is certainly an endless going forth, but in the Notion it is present, it is a progression from one opposed determination to others, from continuity to negativity, from negativity to continuity; but both of these are before us. Of these moments one in the process may be called the true one; Zeno first asserts continuous progression in such a way that no limited space can be arrived at as ultimate, or Zeno upholds progression in this limitation.

> The general explanation which Aristotle gives to this contradiction, is that space and time are not infinitely divided, but are only divisible. But it now appears that, because they are divisible â€” that is, in potentiality â€” they must actually be infinitely divided, for else they could not be divided into infinity. That is the general answer of the ordinary man in endeavouring to refute the explanation of Aristotle. Bayle (Tom. IV. art. ZÃ©non, not. E.) hence says of Aristotleâ€™s answer that it is â€œpitoyable: Câ€™est se moquer du monde que de se servir de cette doctrine; car si Ia matiÃ¨re est divisible Ã  lâ€™infini, elle contient un nombre infini de parties. Ce nâ€™est done point un infini en puissance, câ€™est un infini, qui existe rÃ©ellement, actuellement. Mais quandmÃªme on accorderait cet infini en puissance, qui deviendrait un infini par Ia division actuelle de ses parties, on ne perdrait pas ses avantages; car le mouvement est une chose, qui a la mÃªme vertu, que la division. Il touche une partie de lâ€™espace sans toucher lâ€™autre, et il les touche toutes les unes aprÃ¨s les autres. Nâ€™est-ce pas les distinguer actuellement? Nâ€™est-ce pas faire ce que ferait un gÃ©omÃ¨tre sur une table en tirant des lignes, qui dÃ©signassent tous les demiponces? II ne brise pas Ia table en demi-pouces, mais il y fait nÃ©anmoins une division, qui marque Ia distinction actuelle des parties; et ie ne crois pas quâ€™Aristote ent voulu nier, que si lâ€™on tirait une infinitÃ© de lignes sur un pouce de matiÃ¨re, on nâ€™y introduisit une division, qui reduirait en infini actuel ce qui nâ€™etait selon lui quâ€™un infini virtuel.â€ This si is good! Divisibility is, as potentiality, the universal; there is continuity as well as negativity or the point posited in it â€” but posited as moment, and not as existent in and for itself. I can divide matter into infinitude, but I only can do so; I do not really divide it into infinitude. This is the infinite, that no one of its moments has reality. It never does happen that, in itself, one or other â€” that absolute limitation or absolute continuity â€” actually comes into existence in such a way that the other moment disappears. There are two absolute opposites, but they are moments, i.e. in the simple Notion or in the universal, in thought, if you will; for in thought, in ordinary conception, what is set forth both is and is not at the same time. What is represented either as such. or as an image of the conception, is not a thing; it has no Being, and yet it is not nothing.

> Space and time furthermore, as quantum, form a limited extension, and thus can be measured off; just as I do not actually divide space, neither does the body which is in motion. The partition of space as divided, is not absolute discontinuity [PunktualitÃ¤t], nor is pure continuity the undivided and indivisible; likewise time is not pure negativity or discontinuity, but also continuity. Both are manifested in motion, in which the Notions have their reality for ordinary conception â€” pure negativity as time, continuity as space. Motion itself is just this actual unity in the opposition, and the sequence of both moments in this unity. To comprehend motion is to express its essence in the form of Notion, i.e., as unity of negativity and continuity; but in them neither continuity nor discreteness can be exhibited as the true existence. If we represent space or time to ourselves as infinitely divided, we have an infinitude of points, but continuity is present therein as a space which comprehends them; as Notion, however, continuity is the fact that all these are alike, and thus in reality they do not appear one out of the other like points. But both these moments make their appearance as existent; if they are manifested indifferently, their Notion is no longer posited, but their existence. In.them as existent, negativity is a limited size, and they exist as limited space and time; actual motion is progression through a limited space â€” and a limited time and not through infinite space and infinite time.

> That what is in motion must reach the half is the assertion of continuity, i.e. the possibility of division as mere possibility; it is thus always possible in every space, however small. It is said that it is plain that the half must be reached, but in so saying, everything is allowed, including the fact that it never will be reached; for to say so in one case, is the same as saying it an infinite number of times. We mean, on the contrary, that in a larger space the half can be allowed, but we conceive that we must somewhere attain to a space so small that no halving is possible, or an indivisible, non-continuous space which is no space. This, however, is false, for continuity is a necessary determination; there is undoubtedly a smallest in space, i.e. a negation of continuity, but the negation is something quite abstract. Abstract adherence to the subdivision indicated, that is, to continuous bisection into infinitude, is likewise false, for in the conception of a half, the interruption of continuity is involved. We must say that there is no half of space, for space is continuous; a piece of wood may be broken into two halves, but not space, and space only exists in movement. It might equally be said that space consists of an endless number of points, i.e. of infinitely many limits and thus cannot be traversed. Men think themselves able to go from one indivisible point to another, but they do not thereby get any further, for of these there is an unlimited number. Continuity is split up into its opposite, a number which is indefinite; that is to say, if continuity is not admitted, there is no motion. It is false to assert that it is possible when one is reached, or that which is not continuous; for motion is connection. Thus when it was said that continuity is the presupposed possibility of infinite division, continuity is only the hypothesis; but what is exhibited in this continuity is the being of infinitely many, abstractly absolute limits.

> (b) The second proof, which is also the presupposition of continuity and the manifestation of division, is called â€œAchilles, the Swift.â€ The ancients loved to clothe difficulties in sensuous representations. Of two bodies moving in one direction, one of which is in front and the other following at a fixed distance and moving quicker than the first, we know that the second will overtake the first. But Zeno says, â€œThe slower can never be overtaken by the quicker.â€ And he proves it thus: â€œThe second one requires a certain space of time to reach the place from which the one pursued started at the beginning of the given period.â€ Thus during the time in which the second reached the point where the first was, the latter went over a new space which the second has again to pass through in a part of this period; and in this way it goes into infinity.

         c       d    e   f   g
         B       A     

> B, for instance, traverses two miles (c d) in an hour, A in the same time, one mile (d e); if they are two miles (c d) removed from one another, B has in one hour come to where A was at the beginning of the hour. While B, in the next half hour, goes over the distance crossed by A of one mile (d e), A has got half a mile (e f) further, and so on into infinity. Quicker motion does not help the second body at all in passing over the interval of space by which he is behind: the time which he requires, the slower body always has at its avail in order to accomplish some, although an ever shorter advance; and this, because of the continual division, never quite disappears.

> Aristotle, in speaking of this, puts it shortly thus: â€œThis proof asserts the same endless divisibility, but it is untrue, for the quick will overtake the slow body if the limits to be traversed be granted to it.â€ This answer is correct and contains all that can be said; that is, there are in this representation two periods of time and two distances, which are separated from one another, i.e. they are limited in relation to one another; when, on the contrary, we admit that time and space are continuous, so that two periods of time or points of space are related to one another as continuous, they are, while being two, not two, but identical. In ordinary language we solve the matter in the easiest, way, for we say: â€œBecause the second is quicker, it covers a greater distance in the same time as the slow; it can therefore come to the place from which the first started and get further still.â€ After B, at the end of the first hour, arrives at d and A at e, A in one and the same period, that is, in the second hour, goes over the distance e g, and B the distance d g. But this period of time which should be one, is divisible into that in which B accomplishes d e and that in which B passes through e g. A has a start of the first, by which it gets over the distance e f, so that A is at f at the same period as B is at e. The limitation which, according to Aristotle, is to be overcome, which must be penetrated, is thus that of time; since it is continuous, it must, for the solution of the difficulty, be said that what is divisible into two spaces of time is to be conceived of as one, in which B gets from d to e and from e to g, while A passes over the distance c g. In motion two periods, as well as two points in space, are indeed one.

> If we wish to make motion clear to ourselves, we say that,,the body is in one place and then it goes to another; because it moves, it is no longer in the first, but yet not in the second; were it in either it would be at rest. Where then is it? If we say that it is between both, this is to convey nothing at all, for were it between both, it would be in a place, and this presents the same difficulty. But movement means to be in this place and not to be in it, and thus to be in both alike; this is the continuity of space and time which first makes motion possible. Zeno, in the deduction made by him, brought both these points into forcible opposition. The discretion of space and time we also uphold, but there must also be granted to them the over-stepping of limits, i.e. the exhibition of limits as not being, or as being divided periods of time, which are also not divided. In our ordinary ideas we find the same determinations as those on which the dialectic of Zeno rests; we arrive at saying, though unwillingly, that in one period two distances of space are traversed, but we do not say that the quicker comprehends two moments of time in one; for that we fix a definite space. But in order that the slower may lose its precedence, it must be said that it loses its advantage of a moment of time, and indirectly the moment of space.

> Zeno makes limit. division, the moment of discretion in space and time, the only element which is enforced in the whole of his conclusions, and hence results the contradiction. The difficulty is to overcome thought. for what makes the difficulty is always thought alone, since it keeps apart the moments of an object which in their separation are really united. It brought about the Fall, for man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; but it also remedies these evils.


> (c) The third form, according to Aristotle, is as follows: â€” Zeno says. â€œI The flying arrow rests, and for the reason that what is in motion is always in the self-same Now and the self-same Here, in the indistinguishable;â€ it is here and here and here. It can be said of the arrow that it is always the same, for it is always in the same space and the same time; it does not get beyond its space. does not take in another, that is, a greater or smaller space. That, however, is what we call rest and not motion. In the Here and Now, the becoming â€œotherâ€ is abrogated, limitation indeed being established, but only as moment; since in the Here and Now as such, there is no difference, continuity is here made to prevail against the mere belief in diversity. Each place is a different place, and thus the same; true, objective difference does not come forth in these sensuous relations, but in the spiritual.

> This is also apparent in mechanics; of two bodies the question as to which moves presents itself before us. It requires more than two places â€” three at least â€” to determine which of them moves. But it is correct to say this, that motion is plainly relative; whether in absolute space the eye, for instance, rests, or whether it moves, is all the same. Or, according to a proposition brought forward by Newton, if two bodies move round. one another in a circle, it may be asked whether the one rests or both move. Newton tries to decide this by means of an external circumstance, the strain on the string. When I walk on a ship in a direction opposed to the motion of the ship, this is in relation to the ship, motion, and in relation to all else, rest.

> In both the first proofs, continuity in progression has the predominance; there is no absolute limit, but an overstepping of all limits. Here the opposite is established; absolute limitation, the interruption of continuity, without however passing into something else; while discretion is pre-supposed, continuity is maintained. Aristotle says of this proof: â€œIt arises from the fact that it is taken for granted that time consists of the Now; for if this is not conceded, the conclusions will not follow.â€

> (d) â€œThe fourth proof,â€ Aristotle continues, â€œis derived from similar bodies which move in opposite directions in the space beside a similar body, and with equal velocity, one from one end of the space, the other from the middle. It necessarily results from this that half the time is equal to the double of it. The fallacy rests in this, that Zeno supposes that what is beside the moving body, and what is beside the body at rest, move through an equal distance in equal time with equal velocity, which, however, is untrue.â€

> In a definite space such as a table (A B) let us suppose two bodies of equal length with it and with one another, one of which (C D) lies with one end (C) on the middle (g) of the table, and the other (B F), being in the same direction, has the point (B) only touching the end of the table (h); and supposing they move in opposite directions, and the former (C D) reaches in an hour the end (h) of the table; we have the result ensuing that the one (E F) passes in the half of the time through the same space (1 k) which the other does in the double (g h); hence the half is equal to the double. That is to say, this second passes (let us say, in the point 1) by the whole of the first C D. In the first half-hour 1 goes from m to i, while k only goes from g to n.

> This fourth form deals with the contradiction presented in opposite motion; that which is common is given entirely to one body, while it only does part for itself. Here the distance travelled by one body is the sum of the distance travelled by both, just as when I go two feet east, and from the same point another goes two feet west, we are four feet removed from one another; in the distance moved both are positive, and hence have to be added together. Or if I have gone two feet forwards and two feet backwards, although I have walked four feet, I have not moved from the spot; the motion is then nil, for by going forwards and backwards an opposition ensues which annuls itself.

> This is the dialectic of Zeno; he had a knowledge of the determinations which our ideas of space and time contain, and showed in them their contradiction; Kantâ€™s antinomies do no more than Zeno did here. The general result of the Eleatic dialectic has thus become, â€œthe truth is the one, all else is untrue,â€ just as the Kantian philosophy resulted in â€œwe know appearances only.â€ On the whole the principle is the same; â€œthe content of knowledge is only an appearance and not truth,â€ but there is also a great difference present. That is to say, Zeno and the Eleatics in their proposition signified â€œthat the sensuous world, with its multitudinous forms, is in itself appearance only, and has no truth.â€ But Kant does not mean this, for he asserts: â€œBecause we apply the activity of our thought to the outer world, we constitute it appearance; what is without, first becomes an untruth by the fact that we put therein a mass of determinations. Only our knowledge, the spiritual, is thus appearance; the world is in itself absolute truth; it is our action alone that ruins it, our work is good for nothing.â€ It shows excessive humility of mind to believe that knowledge has no value; but Christ says, â€œAre ye not better than the sparrows?â€ and we are so inasmuch as we are thinking; as sensuous we are as good or as bad as sparrows. Zenoâ€™s dialectic has greater objectivity than this modern dialectic.

> Zenoâ€™s dialectic is limited to Metaphysics; later, with the Sophists, it became general. We here leave the Eleatic school. which perpetuates itself in Leucippus and, on the other side, in the Sophists, in such a way that these last extended the Eleatic conceptions to all reality, and gave to it the relation of consciousness; the former, however, as one who later on worked out the Notion in its abstraction, makes a physical application of it, and one which is opposed to consciousness. There are several other Eleatics mentioned, to Tennemannâ€™s surprise, who, however, cannot interest us. â€œIt is so unexpected,â€ he says (Vol. I., p. 190), â€œthat the Eleatic system should find disciples; and yet Sextus mentions a certain Xeniades.â€

> Hier fÃ¤ngt erst an, ein Licht aufzugehen (es ist zwar noch schwach): Der Verstand wird als das Prinzip anerkannt. Von Anaxagoras sagt schon Aristoteles: Â»Der aber, der sagte, daÃŸ die Vernunft wie in dem Lebenden, so auch in der Natur die Ursache ist der Welt und aller Ordnung, ist wie ein NÃ¼chterner erschienen gegen die [, die] vorher ins Blinde (eikÃª) sprachen.Â« Die Philosophen vor Anaxagoras, sagt Aristoteles, Â»sind den Fechtern, die wir Naturalisten nennen, zu vergleichen. Wie diese oft sich in ihrem Herumtummeln gute StÃ¶ÃŸe tun, aber nicht nach der Kunst, so scheinen auch diese Philosophen kein BewuÃŸtsein Ã¼ber das zu haben, was sie sagen.Â« Dies BewuÃŸtsein hat zuerst Anaxagoras gehabt, indem er sagt, der Gedanke ist das an und fÃ¼r sich seiende Allgemeine, der reine Gedanke ist das Wahre. Anaxagoras ist wie ein NÃ¼chterner unter Trunkenen erschienen; aber auch sein StoÃŸ geht noch ziemlich ins Blaue hinein.
Als Prinzipien haben wir gesehen das Sein, das Werden, das Eins; es sind Gedanken, allgemeine, nichts Sinnliches, auch nicht Vorstellungen der Phantasie; der Inhalt, die Teile desselben aber sind genommen aus dem Sinnlichen, es sind Gedanken in irgendeiner Bestimmung. Anaxagoras nun sagt, das Allgemeine â€“ nicht GÃ¶tter, sinnliche Prinzipien, Elemente, noch Gedanken, die wesentlich als bestimmte sind (Reflexionsbestimmungen) â€“, sondern der Gedanke selbst, an und fÃ¼r sich, das Allgemeine ohne Gegensatz, alles in sich befassend, ist die Substanz. Hierbei mÃ¼ssen wir uns nicht den subjektiven Gedanken vorstellen; wir denken beim Denken sogleich an unser Denken, wie es im BewuÃŸtsein ist. Hier ist dagegen der ganz objektive Gedanke gemeint, das Allgemeine, der tÃ¤tige Verstand; wie wir sagen, es ist Verstand, Vernunft in der Welt, auch in der Natur, â€“ oder wie[369] wir von Gattungen in der Natur sprechen: sie sind das Allgemeine. Ein Hund ist ein Tier, dies ist seine Gattung, sein Substantielles; er selbst ist dies. Dies Gesetz, dieser Verstand, diese Vernunft ist selbst immanent in der Natur, ist das Wesen der Natur; sie ist nicht von auÃŸen formiert, wie die Menschen einen Stuhl machen. Der Tisch ist auch vernÃ¼nftig gemacht, aber es ist ein Ã¤uÃŸerlicher Verstand diesem Holze. Aber diese Ã¤uÃŸere Form, die der Verstand sein soll, fÃ¤llt uns beim Sprechen vom Verstande sogleich ein. Hier aber ist der Verstand, das Allgemeine gemeint, was die immanente Natur des Gegenstandes selbst ist. Dies ist das Prinzip. Bisher hatten wir Gedanken, jetzt ist es der Gedanke selbst, der zum Prinzip gemacht ist.

> Der [[nous]] ist nichtdenkendes Wesen drauÃŸen, das die Welt eingerichtet; so ist der Gedanke des Anaxagoras ganz verdorben, ihm alles philosophische Interesse benommen. Denn ein Individuelles, Einzelnes drauÃŸen ist ganz in die Vorstellung herabgefallen und deren Dualismus; ein denkendes sogenanntes Wesen ist kein Gedanke mehr, ist ein Subjekt. Das wahrhaft Allgemeine ist nicht abstrakt, gerade das Allgemeine (Gute, SchÃ¶ne, Zweck) [ist] dies, in und aus sich selbst das Besondere an und fÃ¼r sich zu bestimmen, â€“ nicht Ã¤uÃŸerlicher Zweck.

### Life

> Vor seiner Philosophie haben wir seine LebensumstÃ¤nde zu betrachten. Mit ihm sehen wir die Philosophie in das eigentliche Griechenland, das bisher noch keine hatte, und zwar nach Athen wandern; bisher war Kleinasien oder Italien der Sitz der Philosophie gewesen. Anaxagoras, selbst ein Kleinasiate, lebte vorzÃ¼glich in Athen, das, wie das Haupt der griechischen Macht, so jetzt auch der Sitz und Mittelpunkt der KÃ¼nste und der Wissenschaften war. Anaxagoras lebte in der groÃŸen Zeit zwischen den medischen Kriegen und dem Zeitalter des Perikles. Er fÃ¤llt in die schÃ¶nste Zeit des griechischen athenischen Lebens und berÃ¼hrt noch den Untergang oder vielmehr den Ãœbergang in den Untergang, in das Sterben des schÃ¶nen athenischen Lebens. Die Schlacht bei[370] Marathon ist in der 72., die bei Salamis in der 75. Olympiade; in der 81. (456 v. Chr.) kam Anaxagoras nach Athen.
Anaxagoras, Ol. 70 (500 v. Chr.) geboren, ist frÃ¼her als Demokrit und dem Alter nach ebenso als Empedokles, doch mit diesen Ã¼berhaupt wie mit Parmenides gleichzeitig; er ist so alt als Zenon. Seine Vaterstadt ist Klazomenai in Lydien, nicht sehr weit von Kolophon und dann Ephesos, auf einer Landenge, die eine groÃŸe Halbinsel mit dem festen Lande zusammenhÃ¤ngt.

> Anaxagoras schlieÃŸt diese Periode, nach ihm beginnt eine neue. Er wird, nach der beliebten Ansicht vom genealogischen Ãœbergehen der Prinzipien von Lehrer auf SchÃ¼ler, weil er aus Ionien war, oft als ein Fortsetzer der ionischen Schule, als ionischer Philosoph vorgestellt; denn Hermotimos von Klazomenai war sein Lehrer. Auch wird er zu diesem Behufe zu einem SchÃ¼ler des Anaximenes gemacht, dessen Geburt aber in Ol. 55-58 gesetzt wird, also fÃ¼nfzehn Olympiaden (d.h. 60 Jahre) frÃ¼her.
Sein Leben besteht kurz darin, daÃŸ er sich auf das Studium der Wissenschaften legte, von den Ã¶ffentlichen Angelegenheiten zurÃ¼ckzog, viele Reisen machte und zuletzt nach einigen im dreiÃŸigsten, wahrscheinlicher im fÃ¼nfundvierzigsten Jahre seines Alters nach Athen kam. Er kam am gÃ¼nstigsten, in der blÃ¼hendsten Zeit der Stadt dahin; Perikles stand an der Spitze des Staats und erhob ihn zum hÃ¶chsten Glanze, das ist der Silberblick des atheniensischen Lebens. Perikles suchte den Anaxagoras auf und lebte mit ihm in sehr vertrautem Umgang. Athen hatte damals den Kulminationspunkt seiner schÃ¶nen GrÃ¶ÃŸe erreicht; besonders ist der Gegensatz von Athen und LakedÃ¤mon in dieser Zeit interessant. Athen und LakedÃ¤mon waren die beiden griechischen Nationen, die um die erste Stelle in Griechenland miteinander[371] wetteiferten. Athens ist im Gegensatze LakedÃ¤mons zu erwÃ¤hnen, â€“ der Prinzipien dieser berÃ¼hmten Staaten. Keine Kunst und Wissenschaft war bei den LakedÃ¤moniern. DaÃŸ Athen der Sitz der Wissenschaften und schÃ¶nen KÃ¼nste war, hatte es der EigentÃ¼mlichkeit seiner Verfassung und seines ganzen Geistes zu danken.

> LakedÃ¤mon ist ebenso seiner Verfassung nach hochzuachten. Die LakedÃ¤monier hatten den strengen dorischen Geist durch ihre konsequente Verfassung geordnet â€“ eine Verfassung, worin der Hauptzug ist, daÃŸ die IndividualitÃ¤t, alle persÃ¶nliche Besonderheit dem Allgemeinen, dem Zwecke des Staats, dem Leben des Staats untergeordnet ist oder vielmehr aufgeopfert war, â€“ daÃŸ das Individuum das BewuÃŸtsein seiner Ehre, GÃ¼ltigkeit usf. nur in dem BewuÃŸtsein der TÃ¤tigkeit, des Lebens, des Handelns fÃ¼r den Staat hat. Ein Volk von solcher gediegenen Einheit, worin Wille des Einzelnen eigentlich ganz verschwunden ist, machte einen unÃ¼berwindlichen Zusammenhang aus; und LakedÃ¤mon wurde deswegen an die Spitze der Griechen gestellt und erhielt die Hegemonie, wie wir sie in den trojanischen Zeiten bei den Argivern sahen.

> Dies ist ein groÃŸes Prinzip, was in jedem wahrhaften Staate sein muÃŸ, was aber bei den LakedÃ¤moniern in seiner Einseitigkeit geblieben ist; diese Einseitigkeit ist von den Atheniensern gemieden, und dadurch sind sie grÃ¶ÃŸer geworden. In LakedÃ¤mon war die EigentÃ¼mlichkeit, PersÃ¶nlichkeit, IndividualitÃ¤t nachgesetzt, und so, daÃŸ das Individuum nicht fÃ¼r sich seine freie Ausbildung, Ã„uÃŸerung haben konnte; sie war nicht anerkannt, daher nicht in Ãœbereinstimmung gebracht, nicht in Einheit gesetzt mit dem allgemeinen Zweck des Staats. Dieses allgemeine Leben, dies Aufheben des Rechts der Besonderheit, der SubjektivitÃ¤t, ging bei den LakedÃ¤moniern sehr weit; und wir finden dasselbe Prinzip in Platons Republik auf seine Weise.

> Aber das Allgemeine ist nur lebendiger Geist, insofern das einzelne BewuÃŸtsein sich als solches in ihm findet, â€“ das[372] Allgemeine nicht das unmittelbare Leben und Sein des Individuums, die Substanz nur ausmacht, sondern das bewuÃŸte Leben. Wie die Einzelheit, die von dem Allgemeinen sich trennt, ohnmÃ¤chtig ist und zugrunde geht, ebenso kann die einseitige allgemeine, die seiende Sitte der IndividualitÃ¤t nicht widerstehen. Der lakedÃ¤monische Geist, der auf die Freiheit des BewuÃŸtseins nicht gerechnet und dessen Allgemeines sich von ihr isoliert hatte, muÃŸte sie deswegen als dem Allgemeinen entgegengesetzt hervorbrechen sehen. Und wenn wir zuerst als Befreier Griechenlands von seinen Tyrannen die Spartaner auftreten sehen, denen selbst Athen die Verjagung der Nachkommen des Peisistratos verdankt, so geht ihr VerhÃ¤ltnis zu ihren Bundesgenossen bald in gemeine, niedertrÃ¤chtige Gewalt Ã¼ber und im Inneren, im Staate ebenso in eine harte Aristokratie sowie die festgesetzte Gleichheit des Eigentums (oder Bestimmtheit des Eigentums, daÃŸ bei jeder Familie ihr Erbgut bliebe und durch Verbannung eigentlichen Geldes und Handels und Wandels die MÃ¶glichkeit der Ungleichheit des Reichtums verbannt wÃ¼rde) in eine Habsucht Ã¼ber, die dem Allgemeinen entgegen brutal und niedertrÃ¤chtig wurde.

> Dies wesentliche Moment der Besonderheit, nicht in den Staat aufgenommen, damit nicht gesetzlich, sittlich (moralisch zunÃ¤chst) gemacht, erscheint als Laster. Alle Momente der Idee sind vorhanden in einer vernÃ¼nftigen Organisation; ist Leber isoliert als Galle, so wÃ¼rde sie darum nicht mehr und nicht weniger tÃ¤tig sein, -aber als feindlich, sie zeigte sich als vom KÃ¶rper, der leiblichen Ã–konomie sich isolierend.

> Den Atheniensern hatte hingegen Solon nicht nur Gleichheit der Rechte, Einheit des Geistes zu ihrer Verfassung gemacht, sondern auch der IndividualitÃ¤t ihren Spielraum gegeben, dem Volke (nicht Ephoren) die Staatsgewalt anvertraut, die es nach Verjagung seiner Tyrannen an sich nahm und so in Wahrheit ein freies Volk wurde. Der Einzelne hatte selbst das Ganze in ihm, sein BewuÃŸtsein und Tun im Ganzen; Ausbildung des freien BewuÃŸtseins muÃŸ sich darin finden.[373]

> Bei den Atheniensern war auch Demokratie und reinere Demokratie als in Sparta. Jeder BÃ¼rger hatte sein substantielles BewuÃŸtsein in der Einheit mit den Gesetzen, mit dem Staate; aber zugleich war der IndividualitÃ¤t, dem Geiste, dem Gedanken des Individuums freigelassen, sich zu gewÃ¤hren, zu Ã¤uÃŸern, zu ergehen. So sehen wir in diesem Prinzip die Freiheit der IndividualitÃ¤t in ihrer GrÃ¶ÃŸe auftreten. Das Prinzip der subjektiven Freiheit erscheint zunÃ¤chst noch verbunden, in Einigkeit mit der allgemeinen Grundlage der griechischen Sittlichkeit, des Gesetzlichen, selbst mit der Mythologie; und so brachte es in seinem Ergehen, indem der Geist, das Genie seine Konzeptionen frei ausgebÃ¤ren konnte, diese groÃŸen Kunstwerke der bildenden schÃ¶nen KÃ¼nste und die unsterblichen Werke der Poesie und Geschichte hervor. Das Prinzip der SubjektivitÃ¤t hatte insofern noch nicht die Form angenommen, daÃŸ die Besonderheit als solche freigelassen, auch der Inhalt ein subjektiv besonderer, wenigstens im Unterschiede von der allgemeinen Grundlage, der allgemeinen Sittlichkeit, der allgemeinen Religion, den allgemeinen Gesetzen sein sollte. Wir sehen also nicht besonders modifizierte EinfÃ¤lle haben, sondern den groÃŸen, sittlichen, gediegenen gÃ¶ttlichen Inhalt in diesen Werken fÃ¼r das BewuÃŸtsein zum Gegenstande gemacht, vor das BewuÃŸtsein Ã¼berhaupt gebracht. Wir werden spÃ¤ter sehen die Form der SubjektivitÃ¤t fÃ¼r sich freiwerden und in den Gegensatz treten gegen das Substantielle, die Sitte, die Religion, das Gesetz.

> Die Grundlage von diesem Prinzip der SubjektivitÃ¤t, aber die noch ganz allgemeine Grundlage, sehen wir im Anaxagoras. Er lebte etwas frÃ¼her als Sokrates, aber sie kannten sich noch. Er kam in dieser Zeit, deren Prinzip eben angegeben ist, nach Athen.

> Athen, nach den persischen Kriegen, unterwarf sich den grÃ¶ÃŸten Teil der griechischen Inseln sowie eine Menge SeestÃ¤dte in Thrakien und sonst weiter hinein ins Schwarze Meer. In diesem edlen, freien, gebildeten Volke der Erste[374] des Staats zu sein, â€“ dies GlÃ¼ck wurde Perikles, und dieser Umstand erhebt ihn in der SchÃ¤tzung der IndividualitÃ¤t so hoch, wie wenige Menschen gesetzt werden kÃ¶nnen. Von allem, was groÃŸ unter den Menschen ist, ist die Herrschaft Ã¼ber den Willen der Menschen, die einen Willen haben, das GrÃ¶ÃŸte, denn diese herrschende IndividualitÃ¤t muÃŸ wie die allgemeinste, so die lebendigste sein, â€“ ein Los fÃ¼r Sterbliche, wie es wenige oder keins mehr gibt. Die GrÃ¶ÃŸe seiner IndividualitÃ¤t war ebenso tief als durchgebildet, ebenso ernst (er hat nie gelacht) als energisch und ruhig; Athen hatte ihn den ganzen Tag. Von Perikles sind uns bei Thukydides einige Reden an das Volk erhalten, denen es wohl wenige Werke an die Seite zu setzen gibt. Unter Perikles findet sich die hÃ¶chste Ausbildung des sittlichen Gemeinwesens, der Schwebepunkt, wo die IndividualitÃ¤t noch unter und im Allgemeinen gehalten ist. Gleich darauf wird die IndividualitÃ¤t Ã¼bermÃ¤chtig, indem ihre Lebendigkeit in die Extreme gefallen, da der Staat noch nicht als Staat selbstÃ¤ndig in sich organisiert ist. Indem das Wesen des athenischen Staats der allgemeine Geist, der Religionsglaube an dies ihr Wesen war, so verschwindet mit dem Verschwinden dieses Glaubens das innere Wesen des Volks, da der Geist nicht als Begriff wie in unseren Staaten ist. Der rasche Ãœbergang hierzu ist der nous die SubjektivitÃ¤t, als Wesen, Reflexionin-sich, â€“ nicht Abstraktion.
Athen war der Sitz, ein Kranz von Sternen der Kunst und Wissenschaft. Wie sich die grÃ¶ÃŸten KÃ¼nstler in Athen sammelten, ebenso haben sich die berÃ¼hmtesten Philosophen und Sophisten dort aufgehalten: Aischylos, Sophokles, Aristophanes, Thukydides, Diogenes von Apollonia, Protagoras, Anaxagoras und andere Kleinasiaten. Kleinasien selbst fiel unter die Herrschaft der Perser, und mit dem Verluste ihrer Freiheit starb auch die Philosophie bei ihnen aus.

> Anaxagoras lebte in dieser Zeit in Athen, ein Freund des[375] Perikles, ehe dieser mit StaatsgeschÃ¤ften sich beschÃ¤ftigte. Aber es wird auch gesagt, er sei in DÃ¼rftigkeit gekommen, weil Perikles ihn vernachlÃ¤ssigt habe, â€“ die Lampe nicht mit 01 versehen, die ihn erleuchtet.

> Wichtiger ist, daÃŸ Anaxagoras, wie nachher Sokrates und viele andere Philosophen, angeklagt wurde wegen Verachtung der GÃ¶tter, welche das Volk dafÃ¼r nÃ¤hme. Es tritt Gegensatz der Prosa des Verstandes gegen poetisch religiÃ¶se Ansicht ein. Bestimmt wird erzÃ¤hlt, Anaxagoras habe die Sonne, die Sterne fÃ¼r glÃ¼hende Steine gehalten (es wird ihm auch, nach anderen, Schuld gegeben, etwas, das die Propheten fÃ¼r ein Wunder â€“ Omen â€“ ausgegeben, auf natÃ¼rliche Weise erklÃ¤rt zu haben); es steht damit in Verbindung, daÃŸ er es vorausgesagt haben soll, daÃŸ am Tage von Aigos Potamos, wo die Athener gegen Lysander ihre letzte Flotte verloren, ein Stein vom Himmel fiel.
Ãœberhaupt konnte schon bei Thales, Anaximander usf. die Bemerkung gemacht werden, daÃŸ sie Sonne, Mond, Erde und Gestirne zu Dingen machten und sie auf verschiedene Weise vorstellten, â€“ Vorstellungen, die Ã¼brigens keine weitere Beachtung verdienen; denn diese Seite gehÃ¶rt eigentlich der Bildung. Alle ihre Vorstellungen von solchen GegenstÃ¤nden enthalten das Gemeinschaftliche, daÃŸ die Natur durch sie entgÃ¶ttert worden. Sie vertilgten die poetische Ansicht der Natur, die allem, was sonst jetzt fÃ¼r leblos gilt, ein eigentliches Leben, etwa auch Empfinden und, wenn man will, ein Sein Ã¼berhaupt nach Weise des BewuÃŸtseins zuschrieb. Diese poetische Ansicht zogen sie in die prosaische herab. Die Sonne wird als materielles Ding genommen, wie wir sie dafÃ¼r halten, ist nicht mehr lebendiger Gott; diese GegenstÃ¤nde sind uns bloÃŸe Dinge, dem Geiste Ã¤uÃŸerliche, geistlose GegenstÃ¤nde. Dinge kann man herleiten von Denken. Dies[376] Denken tut wesentlich, daÃŸ es solche GegenstÃ¤nde, Vorstellungen davon, die man gÃ¶ttlich, poetisch nennen kann, mit dem ganzen Umfange des Aberglaubens, verjagt, sie herabsetzt zu dem, was man natÃ¼rliche Dinge nennt. Denn im Denken weiÃŸ der Geist sich als das wahrhaft Seiende, Wirkliche. Denken ist die IdentitÃ¤t seiner und des Seins; fÃ¼r den Geist setzt sich im Denken das Ungeistige, Ã„uÃŸerliche zu Dingen herab, zum Negativen des Geistes.

> Der Verlust jener Ansicht ist nicht zu beklagen, als ob damit die Einheit mit der Natur, schÃ¶ner Glaube, unschuldige Reinheit und Kindlichkeit des Geistes verlorengegangen wÃ¤re. Unschuldig und kindlich mag sie wohl sein; aber die Vernunft ist eben das Herausgehen aus solcher Unschuld und Einheit mit der Natur. Sobald der Geist sich selbst erfaÃŸt, fÃ¼r sich ist, muÃŸ er eben darum das Andere seiner sich als ein Negatives des BewuÃŸtseins entgegensetzen, d.h. zu einem Geistlosen, zu bewuÃŸt- und leblosen Dingen bestimmen â€“ und erst aus diesem Gegenstande zu sich kommen. Es ist dies diese Befestigung der sich bewegenden Dinge, die wir in den Mythen der Alten antreffen, die z.B. erzÃ¤hlen, daÃŸ die Argonauten die Felsen an der Meerenge des Hellesponts, die vorher wie Scheren sich bewegt hÃ¤tten, festgestellt haben. Ebenso befestigte die fortschreitende Bildung das, was vorher eigene Bewegung und Leben in sich selbst zu haben gemeint wurde, und machte es zu ruhenden Dingen.
Dieser Ãœbergang solcher mythischen Ansicht zur prosaischen kommt hier zum BewuÃŸtsein der Athenienser. Solche prosaische Ansicht setzt voraus, daÃŸ dem Menschen innerlich ganz andere Forderungen aufgehen, als er sonst gehabt hat. Darin liegen also die Spuren der wichtigen, notwendigen Konversion, die in den Vorstellungen der Menschen durch das Erstarken des Denkens, durch das BewuÃŸtsein seiner selbst, durch die Philosophie gemacht ist.

> Die Erscheinung solcher Anklage des Atheismus, die wir noch ausfÃ¼hrlicher bei Sokrates berÃ¼hren werden, ist bei Anaxagoras Ã¤uÃŸerlich aus dem nÃ¤heren Grunde begreiflich,[377] daÃŸ die Athener auf Perikles eifersÃ¼chtig waren; daÃŸ die mit Perikles um den ersten Platz in Athen wetteiferten und ihn nicht unmittelbar (Ã¶ffentlich) anzutasten wagten, seine Lieblinge gerichtlich angriffen und der Neid ihn durch die Anklage seines Freundes zu krÃ¤nken suchte. So hatte man auch seine Freundin Aspasia zur Anklage gebracht; und der edle Perikles muÃŸte, um sie von der Verdammung zu retten, die einzelnen BÃ¼rger Athens mit TrÃ¤nen um ihre Lossprechung bitten. Das athenische Volk forderte in seiner Freiheit an seine Machthaber, denen es ein Ãœbergewicht zulieÃŸ solche Akte, durch welche sie sich ebenso das BewuÃŸtsein ihrer DemÃ¼tigung vor dem Volke gaben; das Volk revanchierte sich so fÃ¼r das Ãœbergewicht, welches die groÃŸen MÃ¤nner hatten, Ã¼bte selbst die Nemesis und setzte sich in Gleichgewicht mit ihnen, so wie sie wiederum das GefÃ¼hl ihrer AbhÃ¤ngigkeit, UnterwÃ¼rfigkeit und Machtlosigkeit vor ihm dartaten.

> Die Nachrichten Ã¼ber den Erfolg dieser Anklage des Anaxagoras sind ganz widersprechend und zweifelhaft; wenigstens befreite ihn Perikles von der Verurteilung zum Tode. Und entweder wurde er, nach einigen, nur zur Verbannung verurteilt, nachdem Perikles ihn vor das Volk gefÃ¼hrt und fÃ¼r ihn sprach und bat, der schon durch sein Alter und Abzehrung und SchwÃ¤che das Mitleid des Volkes erregte. Oder andere sagen, er sei mit Hilfe des Perikles aus Athen geflohen und wurde abwesend zum Tode verurteilt und das Urteil nicht an ihm vollzogen. Oder andere sagen, er sei freigesprochen worden; aber aus VerdruÃŸ Ã¼ber diese Anklage und Besorgnis ihrer Wiederholung habe er Athen freiwillig verlassen, und im etlichen und 60. oder 70. Jahre sei er in Lampsakos in der 88. Olympiade (428 v. Chr.) gestorben.

### The general principle of thought

> Der Zusammenhang seiner Philosophie mit den vorhergehenden ist: In Heraklits Idee als Bewegung sind alle Momente absolut verschwindende; Empedokles ist Zusammenfassen dieser Bewegung in die Einheit, aber eine synthetische, ebenso Leukipp und Demokrit, â€“ aber so, daÃŸ bei Empedokles die Momente dieser Einheit die seienden Elemente des Feuers, Wassers usf. sind, bei diesen aber reine Abstraktionen, an sich seiende Wesen, Gedanken; hierdurch aber ist unmittelbar die Allgemeinheit gesetzt, denn die Entgegengesetzten haben keinen sinnlichen Halt mehr. Die Einheit kehrt als allgemeine in sich zurÃ¼ck aus der Entgegensetzung (in dem Synthesieren ist das Entgegengesetzte noch getrennt von ihr fÃ¼r sich, nicht der Gedanke selbst das Sein), â€“ der Gedanke, als reiner freier ProzeÃŸ in sich selbst, das sich selbst bestimmende Allgemeine, nicht unterschieden vom bewuÃŸten Gedanken. Im Anaxagoras tut sich ein ganz anderes Reich auf.

> Aristoteles sagt: Â»Anaxagoras hat erst diese Bestimmungen angefangenÂ«, â€“ ist also der erste, der das absolute Wesen als Verstand oder Allgemeines aussprach, als Denken (nicht Vernunft). Aristoteles und dann andere nach ihm fÃ¼hren das trockene Faktum an, daÃŸ ein Hermotimos auch aus Klazomenai dazu Veranlassung gegeben; aber deutlich, bestimmt habe dies Anaxagoras getan. Damit ist dann wenig gedient, da wir weiter nichts erfahren von Hermotimos' Philosophie; viel mag es nicht gewesen sein. Andere haben viel historische Untersuchungen Ã¼ber diesen Hermotimos angestellt. Dieser Name kommt noch einmal vor: Î±) Wir haben ihn schon angefÃ¼hrt in der Liste derer, von denen erzÃ¤hlt wird, daÃŸ Pythagoras, vor seinem Leben als Pythagoras, sie gewesen sei. Î²) Wir haben eine Geschichte von[379] Hermotimos: er habe nÃ¤mlich die eigene Gabe besessen, als Seele seinen Leib zu verlassen. Dies sei ihm aber am Ende schlecht bekommen, denn seine Frau, mit der er HÃ¤ndel hatte und die sonst wohl wuÃŸte, wie es damit war, zeigte diesen von seiner Seele verlassenen Leib ihren Bekannten als tot, und er wurde verbrannt, ehe die Seele sich eingestellt hatte, die sich freilich wird verwundert haben. Es ist nicht der MÃ¼he wert, zu untersuchen, was dieser alten Geschichte zugrunde liegt, d.h. wie wir die Sache ansehen wollen; man kÃ¶nnte an VerzÃ¼ckung dabei denken. Wir haben eine Menge solcher Geschichten von alten Philosophen, wie von Pherekydes, Epimenides usf.; daÃŸ dieser z.B. (eine SchlafmÃ¼tze) siebenundfÃ¼nfzig Jahre geschlafen habe.

> {#DasPrinzipDesAnaxagorasWar} Das Prinzip des Anaxagoras war, daÃŸ er den [[nous]] Gedanken oder Verstand Ã¼berhaupt, als das einfache Wesen der Welt, fÃ¼r das Absolute erkannt hat. Die Einfachheit des nous ist nicht ein Sein, sondern Allgemeinheit (Einheit). Allgemeines ist einfach und von sich unterschieden, â€“ aber so, daÃŸ der Unterschied unmittelbar aufgehoben wird und diese IdentitÃ¤t gesetzt, fÃ¼r sich ist, das Wesen nicht ein Scheinen in sich, Einzelheit â€“ Reflexion an und fÃ¼r sich bestimmt â€“ ist. Dies Allgemeine fÃ¼r sich, abgetrennt, existiert rein nur als Denken. Es existiert auch als Natur, gegenstÃ¤ndliches Wesen, aber dann nicht mehr rein fÃ¼r sich, sondern die Besonderheit als ein Unmittelbares an ihm habend; so Raum und Zeit z.B., das Ideellste, Allgemeinste der Natur als solcher. Aber es gibt keinen reinen Raum und Zeit und Bewegung, sondern dies Allgemeine hat die Besonderheit unmittelbar an ihm, â€“ bestimmter Raum, Luft, Erde man kann keinen reinen Raum zeigen, sowenig als die Materie. Denken ist also dies Allgemeine, aber rein fÃ¼r sich: Ich bin Ich, Ich = Ich. Ich unterscheide eins von mir, aber dieselbe reine Einheit bleibt, â€“ nicht Bewegung, ein Unterschied,[380] der nicht unterschieden, FÃ¼rmichsein. Und in allem, was ich denke, wenn das Denken einen bestimmten Inhalt hat, so ist es mein Gedanke, â€“ ich bin mir in diesem Gegenstande ebenso bewuÃŸt.

> {#DiesAllgemeineSoFuerSichSeiende} Dies Allgemeine, so fÃ¼r sich Seiende, tritt aber ebenso dem Einzelnen â€“ oder der Gedanke dem Seienden â€“ bestimmt gegenÃ¼ber. Hier wÃ¤re nun die spekulative Einheit dieses Allgemeinen mit dem Einzelnen zu betrachten, wie diese als absolute Einheit gesetzt ist; aber dies wird freilich bei den Alten nicht angetroffen, â€“ den Begriff selbst zu begreifen. Den sich zu einem System realisierenden, als Universum organisierten Verstand, diesen reinen Begriff haben wir nicht zu erwarten. Wie Anaxagoras den [[nous]] erklÃ¤rt, den Begriff desselben gegeben, gibt Aristoteles nÃ¤her an: Das Allgemeine hat die zwei Seiten, Î±) reine Bewegung zu sein, und Î²) das Allgemeine, Ruhende, Einfache. Es ist darum zu tun, das Prinzip der Bewegung aufzuzeigen, â€“ daÃŸ dies das Sichselbstbewegende und dies das Denken (als fÃ¼r sich existierend) ist. So Aristoteles. Â»Nous ist ihm (Anaxagoras) dasselbe mit Seele.Â« So unterscheiden wir Seele als das Sichselbstbewegende, unmittelbar Einzelne; aber als einfach ist der nous das Allgemeine. Der Gedanke bewegt um etwas willen, der Zweck ist das erste Einfache (die Gattung ist Zweck), er ist das Erste, welches sich zum Resultate macht, â€“ bei den Alten Gutes und BÃ¶ses, d.h. eben Zweck als Positives und als Negatives.

> Diese Bestimmung ist eine sehr wichtige; sie hatte auch bei Anaxagoras noch keine groÃŸe AusfÃ¼hrung. WÃ¤hrend die bisherigen Prinzipien (Aristoteles unterscheidet zuerst QualitÃ¤t, poion dann Materie und Stoff) stoffartig sind, auÃŸer dem Heraklitischen ProzeÃŸ, der drittens Prinzip der Bewegung ist, so tritt viertens das Umweswillen, die Zweckbestimmung mit dem nous ein. Dies ist das in sich Konkrete. Aristoteles fÃ¼gt nach der oben (S. 217) angefÃ¼hrten Stelle[381] hinzu: Â»Nach diesenÂ« (Ioniern und anderen) Â»und nach solchen UrsachenÂ« (Wasser, Feuer usf.), Â»da sie nicht hinreichend sind, die Natur der Dinge zu erzeugen (gennÃªsai), sind die Philosophen von der Wahrheit selbst, wie schon gesagt, gezwungen worden, weiter zu gehen nach dem damit verbundenen Prinzip (tÃªn echomenÃªn archÃªn). Denn daÃŸ auf einer Seite alles sich gut und schÃ¶n verhalte, anderes aber erzeugt werde, â€“ dazu ist weder die Erde noch sonst ein Prinzip hinreichend, auch scheinen jene dies nicht gemeint zu haben, noch macht es sich gut (kalÃ´s echei), dem Selbstbewegen und dem Zufall (automatÃ´ kai tychÃª) ein solches Werk zu Ã¼berlassen.Â« Gut und schÃ¶n drÃ¼ckt den einfachen, ruhenden Begriff aus, VerÃ¤nderung den Begriff in seiner Bewegung.

> Mit diesem Prinzip kommen nun folgende Bestimmungen herein: a) Verstand Ã¼berhaupt ist die sich selbst bestimmende TÃ¤tigkeit; dies fehlte bisher. Das Werden des Heraklit, was nur ProzeÃŸ ist (eimarenÃª), ist noch nicht das sich selbstÃ¤ndig, unabhÃ¤ngig Bestimmende. In der sich selbst bestimmenden TÃ¤tigkeit ist zugleich enthalten, daÃŸ die TÃ¤tigkeit, indem sie den ProzeÃŸ macht, sich erhÃ¤lt als das Allgemeine, Sichselbstgleiche. Das Feuer (der ProzeÃŸ nach Heraklit) erstirbt; es ist Ãœbergang ins Andere, keine SelbstÃ¤ndigkeit. Es ist auch Kreis, RÃ¼ckkehr zum Feuer; aber das Prinzip erhÃ¤lt sich in seinen Bestimmungen nicht. Es ist nur Ãœbergehen ins Entgegengesetzte gesetzt, â€“ nicht das Allgemeine, welches sich in beiden Formen erhÃ¤lt. ÃŸ) Bestimmung der Allgemeinheit liegt darin, wenn sie auch noch nicht fÃ¶rmlich ausgedrÃ¼ckt ist; es bleibt in der Beziehung auf sich in der Bestimmung. Darin liegt 7) Zweck, das Gute.

> Ich habe schon neulich (S. 348 f.) auf den Begriff des Zwecks aufmerksam gemacht. Wir dÃ¼rfen dabei nicht bloÃŸ an die Form des Zwecks denken, wie er in uns, in den BewuÃŸten ist. Wir haben einen Zweck; er ist meine Vorstellung, sie ist[382] fÃ¼r sich, kann sich realisieren oder auch nicht. Es liegt im Zweck die TÃ¤tigkeit des Realisierens, wir vollfÃ¼hren diese Bestimmung; und das Produzierte muÃŸ dem Zwecke gemÃ¤ÃŸ sein, â€“ wenn man nicht ungeschickt ist, muÃŸ das Objekt nichts anderes enthalten als der Zweck. Es ist ein Ãœbergang von der SubjektivitÃ¤t zur ObjektivitÃ¤t: ich bin unzufrieden mit meinem Zweck, daÃŸ er nur subjektiv ist; meine TÃ¤tigkeit ist, ihm diesen Mangel zu benehmen und ihn objektiv zu machen. In der ObjektivitÃ¤t hat sich der Zweck erhalten. Ich habe z.B. den Zweck, ein Haus zu bauen, ich bin deshalb tÃ¤tig; es kommt heraus das Haus, der Zweck ist darin realisiert.

> Wir mÃ¼ssen aber nicht bei der Vorstellung von diesem subjektiven Zweck stehenbleiben, wo beide, ich und der Zweck, selbstÃ¤ndig existieren, wie wir dies gewÃ¶hnlich tun. Z.B. Gott, als weise, regiert nach Zwecken; da ist die Vorstellung, daÃŸ der Zweck fÃ¼r sich ist, in einem vorstellenden, weisen Wesen. 

> {DasAllgemeineDesZwecks} Das Allgemeine des Zwecks ist aber, daÃŸ er eine fÃ¼r sich feste Bestimmung ist und daÃŸ dann diese Bestimmung, die durch die Bestimmung der TÃ¤tigkeit gesetzt ist, weiter tÃ¤tig ist, den Zweck zu realisieren, ihm Dasein zu geben; aber dies Dasein ist beherrscht durch den Zweck, und er ist darin erhalten. Dies ist, daÃŸ der Zweck das Wahrhafte, die Seele einer Sache ist. Das Gute gibt sich selbst Inhalt, indem es mit diesem Inhalt tÃ¤tig ist, dieser Inhalt sich an Anderes wendet, so erhÃ¤lt sich in der RealitÃ¤t die erste Bestimmung, und es kommt kein anderer Inhalt heraus. Was vorher schon vorhanden war, und was nachher ist, nachdem der Inhalt in die Ã„uÃŸerlichkeit getreten ist, beides ist dasselbe; und das ist der Zweck.

> {#DasGroessteBeispielBietetDasLebendige} Das grÃ¶ÃŸte Beispiel hiervon bietet das Lebendige dar; es erhÃ¤lt sich so, weil es an sich Zweck ist. Das Lebendige existiert, arbeitet, hat Triebe, diese Triebe sind seine Zwecke; es weiÃŸ nichts von diesen Zwecken, es ist bloÃŸ lebendig, â€“ es sind erste Bestimmungen, die fest sind. Das Tier arbeitet, diese Triebe zu befriedigen, d.h. den Zweck zu erreichen; es verhÃ¤lt sich zu Ã¤uÃŸeren Dingen, teils mechanisch, teils chemisch. Aber das VerhÃ¤ltnis seiner TÃ¤tigkeit bleibt nicht mechanisch, chemisch. Das Produkt, das Resultat ist vielmehr das Tier selbst, es ist Selbstzweck, es bringt in seiner TÃ¤tigkeit nur sich selbst hervor; jene mechanischen usf. VerhÃ¤ltnisse werden darin vernichtet und verkehrt. Im mechanischen und chemischen VerhÃ¤ltnis ist dagegen das Resultat ein Anderes; das Chemische erhÃ¤lt sich nicht. Im Zwecke aber ist das Resultat der Anfang, â€“ Anfang und Ende sind gleich. Selbsterhaltung ist fortdauerndes Produzieren, wodurch nichts Neues entsteht â€“ ZurÃ¼cknahme der TÃ¤tigkeit zum Hervorbringen seiner selbst â€“, immer nur das Alte.

> Das formelle Philosophieren vermag die [[dialectic|Dialektik]] nicht anders zu betrachten, als daÃŸ sie eine Kunst sei, das Vorgestellte oder auch die Begriffe zu verwirren, das Nichts derselben aufzuzeigen, so daÃŸ ihr Resultat nur negativ ist. Diese Dialektik sehen wir bei Platon hÃ¤ufig, teils in den mehr eigentlich sokratischen, moralischen Dialogen, teils auch in den vielen Dialogen, welche sich auf die Vorstellung der Sophisten von der Wissenschaft beziehen. Aber der Begriff der wahrhaften Dialektik ist, daÃŸ sie die notwendige Bewegung der reinen Begriffe aufzeigt, nicht als ob sie dieselben dadurch in Nichts auflÃ¶ste, sondern eben das Resultat ist, daÃŸ sie diese Bewegung sind und (das Resultat einfach ausgedrÃ¼ckt) das Allgemeine eben die Einheit solcher entgegengesetzten Begriffe. Das vollkommene BewuÃŸtsein Ã¼ber diese Natur der Dialektik finden wir nun zwar nicht bei Platon, aber sie selbst, nÃ¤mlich das absolute Wesen auf diese Weise in reinen Begriffen erkannt, und die Darstellung der Bewegung dieser Begriffe.

> Was das Studium der Platonischen Dialektik erschwert, ist diese Entwicklung und das Aufzeigen des Allgemeinen aus den Vorstellungen. Dieser Anfang, der das Erkennen zu erleichtern scheint, macht wieder die Schwierigkeit grÃ¶ÃŸer, da er in ein Feld hineinzieht, worin ganz anderes gilt als in der Vernunft, und dies Feld gegenwÃ¤rtig macht, dahingegen, wenn in den reinen Begriffen allein fortgegangen und sich bewegt wird, gar nicht an jenes erinnert wird. Allein gerade dadurch gewinnen die Begriffe auch grÃ¶ÃŸere Wahrheit. Denn die rein logische Bewegung scheint uns sonst leicht fÃ¼r sich zu sein, ein eigenes Land, welches ein anderes neben ihm hat, das ebenso auch gilt. Aber indem sie dort zusammengebracht werden, so erscheint das Spekulative erst in seiner Wahrheit, daÃŸ es nÃ¤mlich die einzige Wahrheit ist, â€“ die Verwandlung des sinnlichen Meinens in das Denken.

> Es ist schon frÃ¼her bei Sokrates bemerkt, daÃŸ zum Teil das Interesse der Sokratischen Bildung war, zunÃ¤chst das Allgemeine im Menschen zum BewuÃŸtsein zu bringen. Dies kÃ¶nnen wir von hier aus als abgetan ansehen und nur bemerken, daÃŸ eine Menge von Dialogen des Platon bloÃŸ darauf gehen, eine allgemeine Vorstellung zum BewuÃŸtsein zu bringen, von der wir weiter keine MÃ¼he haben; so erregt die WeitlÃ¤ufigkeit des Platon oft ÃœberdruÃŸ.

> In unserem BewuÃŸtsein ist zunÃ¤chst das Einzelne, das unmittelbar Einzelne, das sinnlich Reale, oder es sind auch Verstandesbestimmungen, die uns als ein Letztes, Wahrhaftes gelten. Wir nehmen so das Ã„uÃŸerliche, Sinnliche, Reale im Gegensatz zum Ideellen. Dies ist aber das Allerrealste, das allein Reale; und daÃŸ es das einzig Reale ist, ist die Einsicht Platons: Das Allgemeine ist das Ideelle, das Wahre ist das Allgemeine, der Gedanke bestimmt gegen das Sinnliche. Der Inhalt vieler Dialoge ist, zu zeigen, daÃŸ das, was als Einzelnes, Vieles ist, nicht das Wahrhafte sei: man muÃŸ im Einzelnen nur das Allgemeine betrachten. Das Allgemeine ist zunÃ¤chst unbestimmt, es ist die Abstraktion und ist als solche nicht konkret in sich; aber es kommt wesentlich auf die weitere Bestimmung des Allgemeinen in sich an. Dieses Allgemeine hat nun Platon die Idee (eidos) genannt, was wir zunÃ¤chst Gattung, Art Ã¼bersetzen; und die Idee ist auch allerdings die Gattung, die Art, die aber mehr durch den Gedanken gefaÃŸt ist, mehr fÃ¼r den Gedanken ist. Man muÃŸ deshalb aber nicht unter Idee etwas Transzendentales, weit Hinausliegendes sich denken; eidos; ist nicht in der Vorstellung substantiiert, isoliert, sondern die Gattung, das Genus. Idee ist uns gelÃ¤ufiger unter dem Namen des Allgemeinen. Das SchÃ¶ne, das Wahre, Gute fÃ¼r sich selbst ist Gattung. Wenn freilich unser Verstand meint, Gattung sei nur dies, daÃŸ das Ã„uÃŸerliche fÃ¼r uns zum Merkmal, zur Bequemlichkeit zusammengefaÃŸt sei â€“ sie sei ein Zusammenfassen von gleichen Bestimmungen, von mehreren Einzelnen, gemacht durch unsere Reflexion â€“, so haben wir allerdings das Allgemeine in ganz Ã¤uÃŸerer Form. Das Tier ist Gattung, es ist lebendig; dies ist seine Gattung, die Lebendigkeit ist sein Substantielles, Wahres, Reelles; nimmt man dem Tier das Leben, so ist es nichts.

> Das Bestreben Platons war nun, diesem Allgemeinen eine Bestimmung zu geben. Das nÃ¤chste ist die Einsicht, daÃŸ das Sinnliche, das unmittelbar Seiende, die Dinge, die uns erscheinen, nichts Wahres sind, weil sie sich verÃ¤ndern, durch Anderes bestimmt werden, nicht durch sich selbst. Dies ist eine Hauptseite, von der Platon oft ausgeht. Das Sinnliche, BeschrÃ¤nkte, Endliche ist das, was nur ist im VerhÃ¤ltnis zu einem Anderen, nur relativ ist; dies ist nichts Wahres im objektiven Sinn, wenn wir auch ganz wahre Vorstellungen davon haben. Es ist an ihm selbst nicht wahr; es ist sowohl es selbst als das Andere, das auch als Seiendes gilt; es ist so der Widerspruch und der unaufgelÃ¶ste Widerspruch; es ist, und das Andere hat Macht in ihm. Gegen diese Form des Endlichen ist die Dialektik des Platon besonders gerichtet. 

> Es ist schon frÃ¼her erinnert, daÃŸ die Platonische Dialektik den Zweck hat, die endlichen Vorstellungen der Menschen zu verwirren und aufzulÃ¶sen, um das BedÃ¼rfnis der Wissenschaft, diese Richtung auf das, was ist, in ihrem BewuÃŸtsein hervorzubringen. Viele Dialoge des Platon haben diesen Zweck, und sie enden ohne einen affirmativen Inhalt. Ein Inhalt, den er sehr oft behandelt, ist, daÃŸ er von der Tugend, Wissenschaft aufzeigt, daÃŸ nur eine Tugent, nur eins das Wahre ist; er mache dann so das allgemeine Gute hervorgehen aus den besonderen Tugenden. Die Dialektik hat insofern das Interesse, hat die Wirkung, das Besondere zu konfundieren; und dies geschieht dadurch, daÃŸ aufgezeigt wird seine Endlichkeit, die Negation, die in ihm vorhanden ist, daÃŸ es nicht in der Tat ist, was es ist, sondern in sein Gegenteil Ã¼bergehe, daÃŸ es eine Grenze hat, eine Negation seiner, die ihm wesentlich ist. Wird diese aufgezeigt, festgehalten, so vergeht es, ist ein Anderes als das, fÃ¼r welches es angenommen wird. Diese Dialektik ist die Bewegung des Gedankens; sie ist wesentlich auf Ã¤uÃŸerliche Weise, fÃ¼r das reflektierende BewuÃŸtsein nÃ¶tig, um das Allgemeine, was unsterblich ist, an und fÃ¼r sich ist, unverÃ¤nderlich ist, hervorgehen zu lassen. Die Dialektik, um das Besondere aufzulÃ¶sen und so das Allgemeine zu produzieren, ist noch nicht die wahrhafte Dialektik, noch nicht in ihrer wahrhaften Richtung; es ist eine Dialektik, die Platon gemeinschaftlich hat mit den Sophisten, die es sehr gut verstanden haben, das Besondere aufzulÃ¶sen.

> Die weitere Dialektik hat dann die Bestimmung, das Allgemeine, das durch die Verwirrung des Besonderen hervorgeht, in ihm selbst zu bestimmen und in ihm die GegensÃ¤tze aufzulÃ¶sen, so daÃŸ diese AuflÃ¶sung des Widerspruchs das Affirmative ist. So ist das Allgemeine bestimmt als das, welches die WidersprÃ¼che, die GegensÃ¤tze in sich auflÃ¶st, in sich aufgelÃ¶st hat, mithin als das Konkrete, als das in sich Konkrete. Die Dialektik in dieser hÃ¶heren Bestimmung ist die eigentlich Platonische. So ist die Dialektik als spekulativ, nicht mit einem negativen Resultat endigend; sondern sie zeigt die Vereinigung der GegensÃ¤tze auf, die sich vernichtet haben. Hier fÃ¤ngt das fÃ¼r den Verstand Schwierige an. Auch Platon ist selbst noch auf rÃ¤sonierende Weise dialektisch; die Form der Methode ist noch nicht rein fÃ¼r sich ausgebildet. Seine Dialektik ist oft bloÃŸ rÃ¤sonierend, von einzelnen Gesichtspunkten ausgehend; oft hat sie nur ein negatives Resultat, oft ist sie ohne Resultat. Andererseits ist Platon selbst gegen diese nur rÃ¤sonierende Dialektik gerichtet, aber man sieht, daÃŸ es nicht ohne Schwierigkeit ist; es macht ihm MÃ¼he, den Unterschied gehÃ¶rig hervorzuheben.

> Was nun die spekulative Dialektik des Platon anbetrifft, so ist dies, was bei ihm anfÃ¤ngt, das Interessanteste, aber auch das Schwierigste in seinen Werken, â€“ so daÃŸ man es gewÃ¶hnlich nicht kennenlernt, indem man Platonische Schriften studiert. Das Wichtigste in der Platonischen Philosophie ist bei Tennemann gerade gar nicht aufgefaÃŸt, â€“ einiges als dÃ¼rre ontologische Bestimmungen zusammengetragen. Es ist geistlos, zu sehen beim Platon, ob was fÃ¼r sie abfÃ¤llt.

> Was sind nun dies fÃ¼r Gedanken, auf die es ankommt? Was sind die reinen Gedanken? Denn die dianoia unterscheidet Platon davon. Man kann Ã¼ber vieles Gedanken haben, wenn man Ã¼brigens Gedanken hat. So meint es Platon nicht. Die wahrhaft spekulative GrÃ¶ÃŸe Platons, das, wodurch er Epoche macht in der Geschichte der Philosophie und damit in der Weltgeschichte Ã¼berhaupt, ist die nÃ¤here Bestimmung der Idee, â€“ eine Erkenntnis, welche denn einige Jahrhunderte spÃ¤ter Ã¼berhaupt das Grundelement in der GÃ¤rung der Weltgeschichte und der neuen Gestaltung des menschlichen Geistes ausmacht.

> Diese nÃ¤here Bestimmung kann aus dem Vorhergehenden so gefaÃŸt werden, daÃŸ Platon Î±) das Absolute gefaÃŸt hat als das Sein des Parmenides, aber als das Allgemeine identisch mit dem Nichts, wie Heraklit sagt: das Sein ist sowenig als das Nichts, â€“ dies Werden in einem; Î²) die pythagoreische Dreiheit (in Zahlbestimmungen) in Gedanken ausgedrÃ¼ckt hat, Ã¼berhaupt das Absolute als Einheit des Seins und Nichtseins, Einen und Vielen gefaÃŸt hat. Platon ist Vereinigung der vorhergehenden Prinzipien: Î±) Sein, aber als Allgemeines, Gutes, Wahres, SchÃ¶nes, bestimmt als Gattung, Zweck, d.h. Ã¼ber das Besondere, Mannigfaltige herrschend es durchdringend, produzierend; â€“ diese selbstproduzierende TÃ¤tigkeit ist noch nicht entwickelt, Platon verfÃ¤llt oft in Ã¤uÃŸerliche ZweckmÃ¤ÃŸigkeit; Î²) Bestimmtheit, Unterschied, pythagoreische Zahlen; Î³) Heraklits VerÃ¤nderung und eleatische Dialektik: letztere Ã¤uÃŸerliches Tun des Subjekts, den Widerspruch zu zeigen, â€“ jetzt objektive Dialektik (Heraklit), VerÃ¤nderung, Ãœbergehen der Dinge an ihnen selbst d. i. der Ideen, d. i. hier ihrer Kategorien, nicht die Ã¤uÃŸerliche VerÃ¤nderlichkeit, sondern inneres Ãœbergehen aus und durch sich selbst; Î´) Sokrates' Denken, das Sokrates nur zum Behuf der moralischen Reflexion-in-sich des Subjekts aufgegeben, als objektiv, â€“ die Idee ist Allgemeines, Gedanke, und ist. Die vorhergehenden Philosophien verschwinden, nicht weil sie widerlegt sind, sondern in ihm.

> Platons Untersuchung versiert ganz im reinen Gedanken; und die reinen Gedanken an und fÃ¼r sich betrachten, heiÃŸt Dialektik. Viele seiner Dialoge sind so dialektisch. Solche reine Gedanken sind: Sein und Nichtsein (to on, to ouk on), das Eine und Viele, das Unendliche (Unbegrenzte) und Begrenzte (Begrenzende). Dies sind die GegenstÃ¤nde, die er fÃ¼r sich betrachtet, â€“ also die rein logische, abstruseste Betrachtung; dies kontrastiert dann freilich sehr mit der Vorstellung von dem schÃ¶nen, anmutigen, gemÃ¼tlichen Inhalt des Platon. Diese Betrachtung ist ihm Ã¼berhaupt das HÃ¶chste der Philosophie.

> Dies ist es, was Platon Ã¼berall als das wahrhafte Philosophieren und Erkennen der Wahrheit ausspricht; darin setzt er den Unterschied des Philosophen vom Sophisten. Die Sophisten betrachten dagegen das Erscheinende (halten es in der Meinung fest), â€“ auch Gedanken, aber nicht die reinen Gedanken, das, was an und fÃ¼r sich ist. Dies ist eine Seite, daÃŸ mancher unbefriedigt von dem Studium der Platonischen Werke weggeht. Die angenehmen Einleitungen versprechen, auf einem blumigen Pfade in die Philosophie â€“ und in die hÃ¶chste, die Platonische â€“ einzufÃ¼hren. Das geht bald aus. Siehe, da kommen dann als das HÃ¶chste die Untersuchungen Ã¼ber das Eine und Viele, Sein und Nichts. So war's nicht gemeint; und man geht still davon weg. Man wundert sich, daÃŸ Platon darin die Erkenntnis sucht. Es gehÃ¶rt zum Studium der Dialoge Platons ein interesseloser, gleichgÃ¼ltiger Geist. Wenn man einen Dialog anfÃ¤ngt so findet man eine herrliche Einleitung, schÃ¶ne Szenen; man findet darin Erhebendes, fÃ¼r die Jugend besonders zusagend. Hat man sich von dem erst einnehmen lassen, so kommt man an das eigentlich Dialektische, an das Spekulative. So geschieht es z.B. im Phaidon, den Mendelssohn modernisiert und in Wolffische Metaphysik verwandelt hat; Anfang und Ende ist erhebend, schÃ¶n, die Mitte lÃ¤ÃŸt sich mit der Dialektik ein. Hat man sich durch jene schÃ¶nen Szenen erheben lassen, so muÃŸ man jetzt darauf verzichten und sich von den Dornen und Disteln der Metaphysik stechen lassen. Es werden so sehr heterogene Stimmungen erfordert, um die Dialoge Platons durchzugehen, und eine GleichgÃ¼ltigkeit gegen die verschiedenen Interessen. Liest man mit dem Interesse der Spekulation, so Ã¼berschlÃ¤gt man das, was als das SchÃ¶nste gilt; hat man das Interesse der Erhebung, Erbauung usf., so Ã¼bergeht man das Spekulative, findet es seinem Interesse unangemessen. Es geht einem wie dem JÃ¼nglinge in der Bibel, der dies und das getan und Christus fragte, was er tun solle, ihm zu folgen. Aber als der Herr ihm gebot: Verkauf deine Sachen und gib sie den Armen, so ging der JÃ¼ngling traurig fort; so war es nicht gemeint. So haben es manche gut gemeint mit der Philosophie. Vom Wahren, Guten und SchÃ¶nen ist ihnen die Brust voll, mÃ¶chten's erkennen und schauen, und was wir tun sollen; haben $[$J. F.$]$ Fries und Gott weiÃŸ wen studiert, ihre Brust schwillt vom guten Willen.

> Die dialektische Bewegung im Gedanken hat nun VerhÃ¤ltnis zum Allgemeinen. Das ist die Bestimmung der Idee; sie ist das Allgemeine, aber als das sich selbst Bestimmende, das konkret in sich ist. Dieses kommt nur durch Bewegung in solchen Gedanken, die Gegensatz, Unterschied in sich enthalten. Die Idee ist dann Einheit dieser Unterschiede; und so ist sie bestimmte Idee. Das ist Hauptseite in der Erkenntnis. Sokrates blieb beim Guten, Allgemeinen, an sich konkreten Gedanken stehen; er hat sie nicht entwickelt, nicht durch die Entwicklung aufgezeigt. Durch die dialektische Bewegung und Reduktion zum Resultate wÃ¼rde man die bestimmte Idee erhalten. Es ist nun Mangel bei Platon, daÃŸ beides auseinanderfÃ¤llt. Er spricht von Gerechtigkeit, Gutem, Wahrem. Es ist dabei nicht ihre Entstehung aufgezeigt; sie erscheinen nicht als Resultat, sondern als unmittelbar aufgenommene Voraussetzung. Das BewuÃŸtsein hat die unmittelbare Ãœberzeugung, daÃŸ sie der hÃ¶chste Zweck sind aber diese ihre Bestimmtheit ist nicht gefunden. Viele Dialoge enthalten so nur negative Dialektik; das ist die sokratische Unterredung. Zwecke, Vorstellungen, Meinungen der Individuen werden verwirrt, um BedÃ¼rfnis nach Erkenntnis zu erwecken. Dies lÃ¤ÃŸt uns unbefriedigt, weil die Konfusion das Letzte ist. Konkrete Vorstellungen, nicht reine Gedanken werden behandelt. Andere Dialoge stellen Dialektik reiner Gedanken dar; so der Parmenides. Das dogmatische Werk Platons Ã¼ber die Ideen ist verloren; in seinen mÃ¼ndlichen Reden verfuhr er auch systematisch. Aber es sind auch noch Dialoge Ã¼ber diesen Gegenstand Ã¼brig, die, eben weil sie mit dem reinen Gedanken umgehen, darum auch zu den schwersten gehÃ¶ren: nÃ¤mlich der Sophist, Philebos und besonders auch Parmenides. Diese abstrakt spekulative Idee finden wir zunÃ¤chst im Sophisten und dann im Philebos in ihrem reinen Begriffe ausgedrÃ¼ckt. Das Zusammenfassen der GegensÃ¤tze in Eines und das Aussprechen dieser Einheit fehlt im Parmenides. Andere Dialoge haben ebenso mehr nur dies negative Resultat. Wieder in anderen spricht Platon auch diese Einheit aus; so der Philebos und der Sophist.

> Im Sophisten untersucht Platon die reinen Begriffe oder Ideen (eidÃª, Arten; denn die Ideen sind in der Tat nichts anderes) von Bewegung und Ruhe, Sichselbstgleichheit und Anderssein, Sein und Nichtsein. Er beweist hier gegen Parmenides, daÃŸ das Nichtsein ist, ebenso, daÃŸ das Einfache, Sichselbstgleiche an dem Anderssein teilhat, die Einheit an der Vielheit. Von den Sophisten sagt er, daÃŸ sie im Nichtsein stehenbleiben, und widerlegt nun auch die Sophisten, deren ganzer Standpunkt Nichtsein, Empfindung, das Viele ist. Platon hat das Allgemeine also so bestimmt, daÃŸ das Wahrhafte z.B. Einheit des Eins und Vielen, Seins und Nichtseins ist; aber zugleich hat er auch vermieden, oder es lag in seinem Bestreben, zu vermeiden die Zweideutigkeit, die darin liegt, wenn wir von der Einheit des Seins und Nichts usf. sprechen. Bei diesem Ausdruck legen wir den Hauptakzent auf die Einheit. Da verschwindet der Unterschied, als wenn wir nur von ihm abstrahierten. Platon hat sich den Unterschied derselben ebenso auch zu erhalten gesucht. Der Sophist ist weitere AusfÃ¼hrung des Seins und Nichtseins: Alle Dinge sind, haben _ousia_; ebenso kommt ihnen auch _ouk on_ zu; indem die Dinge verschieden sind, eins das andere des anderen, so liegt auch die Bestimmung des Negativen darin. Er sagt also: das Seiende hat teil am Sein, aber ebenso auch am Nichtsein; das Teilhabende hat so beides in einem, dieses ist dann aber auch ebenso verschieden vom Sein und Nichtsein.

> Vorerst drÃ¼ckt Platon im Sophisten das nÃ¤here BewuÃŸtsein Ã¼ber die Ideen als abstrakte Allgemeinheiten aus, daÃŸ sie nur dies sind, dabei ist nicht stehenzubleiben, â€“ es ist der Einheit der Idee mit sich selbst entgegen. Platon widerlegt Î±) das Sinnliche, Î²) die Ideen. Platon betrachtet daselbst die zwei Vorstellungen: 1. daÃŸ das Substantielle nur das KÃ¶rperliche sei (spÃ¤ter Materialismus) und nichts RealitÃ¤t habe, als was man mit den HÃ¤nden greifen kÃ¶nne, $[$ wie $]$ Steine und Eichen, 2. Â»gehen wir zu den anderen, zu den Freunden der Ideen. Ihre Vorstellung ist, daÃŸ das Substantielle unkÃ¶rperlich, intellektuell sei, und sie trennen das Feld der VerÃ¤nderung (genesin) davon ab: in die VerÃ¤nderung, Werden (genesin) falle das Sinnliche, â€“ das Allgemeine sei fÃ¼r sich. Diese stellen die Ideen als unbeweglich vor und sehen die Bestimmungen der AktivitÃ¤t und PassivitÃ¤t.Â« Platon setzt entgegen, daÃŸ dem wahrhaft Seienden ( _pantelÃ´s onti_ ) Bewegung, Leben, Seele und Denken ( _phronÃªsis_ /) nicht abgesprochen werden kÃ¶nnen, daÃŸ der _nous_ nirgends und in keinem sein kÃ¶nne, wenn es unbewegt ist. Platon hat ein ausdrÃ¼ckliches BewuÃŸtsein, weitergegangen zu sein als Parmenides: Â»Das Nichtsein ist gar nicht, und du halte den Gedanken entfernt von diesem Wege.Â«

> Diese Dialektik nun kÃ¤mpft hauptsÃ¤chlich gegen zweierlei: erstens gegen die allgemeine Dialektik, Dialektik im gewÃ¶hnlichen Sinne. Von dieser haben wir auch schon gesprochen; Beispiele finden sich besonders bei den Sophisten, auf deren (falsche) Dialektik Platon oft zurÃ¼ckkommt. (Dieser Unterschied ist nicht klar genug behandelt.) Die Sophisten (Protagoras) und andere sagten so: Es ist nichts an und fÃ¼r sich; bitter ist nichts Objektives; was einigen bitter, ist fÃ¼r andere sÃ¼ÃŸ: ebenso ist groÃŸ, klein usf. relativ; das GroÃŸe ist unter anderen UmstÃ¤nden klein, das Kleine groÃŸ; ebenso Mehr oder Weniger. So ist keine Bestimmung fest. Platon erklÃ¤rt sich hiergegen. Platon unterscheidet hier diese reine dialektische Erkenntnis (Einsicht, dem Begriffe, dem Wesen nach) von der gemeinen Vorstellungsart des Entgegengesetzten auf bestimmte Weise. Die Einheit des Entgegengesetzten schwebt nÃ¤mlich jedem BewuÃŸtsein Ã¼berhaupt vor; aber das BewuÃŸtsein, dem das VernÃ¼nftige nicht zum BewuÃŸtsein kommt, hÃ¤lt dabei das Entgegengesetzte immer auseinander. DaÃŸ alles eins ist, sagen wir von jedem Dinge: Â»Es ist dies Eine, und ebenso zeigen wir auch die Vielheit an ihm auf, viele Teile und EigenschaftenÂ«, â€“ aber es wird dabei gesagt, es sei in ganz anderer RÃ¼cksicht Eins, als es Vieles ist, bringen diese Gedanken nicht zusammen. So geht das Vorstellen und Reden von einem herÃ¼ber und hinÃ¼ber zum anderen. Dies HerÃ¼ber- und HinÃ¼bergehen, mit BewuÃŸtsein angestellt, so ist es die leere Dialektik, die die GegensÃ¤tze nicht vereinigt und nicht zur Einheit kommt.

> Platon sagt hierÃ¼ber: Â»Wenn jemand seine Freude daran hat, als ob er etwas Schweres gefunden hÃ¤tte, daÃŸ er die Gedanken ( _tous logous_ , die GrÃ¼nde) von einer Bestimmung zur anderen herÃ¼ber- und hinÃ¼berzieht, so hat er nichts PreiswÃ¼rdiges getanÂ«, ist im Irrtum; nÃ¤mlich man zeigt Mangel, Negation am einen und geht zum anderen. Â»Denn das ist weder etwas Vortreffliches noch Schweres.Â« Jene Dialektik, die eine Bestimmung aufhebt, indem sie die andere konstatiert, ist eine unrichtige. Â»Das Schwere und Wahrhafte ist dieses, zu zeigen, daÃŸ das, was das Andere ( _heteron_ ) ist, Dasselbe ist, und was Dasselbe ist ( _tauton on_ ), ein Anderes ist, und zwar in einer und derselben RÃ¼cksicht; nach derselben Seite, daÃŸ das Eine ihnen geschehen ist (d.h. Demselben zu sein ein Anderes, und dem Anderen zu sein Dasselbe), wird auch die andere Bestimmung an ihnen aufgezeigt ( _ekeinÃª kai kat' ekeino ho phÃªsi toutÃ´_ â€“ verschiedene Leseart _touto â€“ peponthenai poteron_ ). Dagegen zu zeigen, daÃŸ Dasselbe auf irgendeine Weise ( _hamÃª ge pÃª_ , in gewisser RÃ¼cksicht, irgendwie) ein Anderes und das Andere auch Dasselbe, daÃŸ das GroÃŸe auch kleinÂ« (z.B. Protagoras' WÃ¼rfel) Â»und das Ã„hnliche auch unÃ¤hnlich sei, und sein Gefallen daran haben, so in dem Gedanken (durch GrÃ¼nde) immer das Entgegengesetzte vorzubringen, â€“ dies ist keine wahrhafte Einsicht (Betrachtung, elenchos) und offenbar ein Erzeugnis solcher, welche erst das Wesen zu berÃ¼hren anfangen; und muÃŸ einer sehr ein Neuling sein im Denken. Alles voneinander abzusondern, ist ein ungeschicktes Verfahren des ungebildeten, unphilosophischen BewuÃŸtseins. Es ist das vollkommene Ausgehen aller Gedanken, alles auseinanderfallen zu lassen; denn eben die Vereinigung der Arten ist der Gedanke.Â« Es spricht so Platon bestimmt gegen diese Dialektik, etwas zu widerlegen zu wissen nach irgendeinem Gesichtspunkt usw.

> Wir sehen, daÃŸ Platon in Ansehung des Inhalts nichts anderes ausdrÃ¼ckt, als was die Indifferenz in der Differenz genannt worden â€“ Differenz absolut Entgegengesetzter, wie Eins und Vieles, Sein und Nichtsein, und die Einheit von diesen, und daÃŸ er diesem spekulativen Erkennen das gemeine positive so wohl als negative Denken entgegensetzt, â€“ jenes, das diese Gedanken nicht zusammenbringt, eines [und] auch das andere getrennt gelten lÃ¤ÃŸt oder negativ zwar der Einheit sich bewuÃŸt ist, aber einer oberflÃ¤chlichen, auseinandergehenden Einheit, worin die beiden Momente in der verschiedenen RÃ¼cksicht sich trennen.

> Das Zweite, wogegen Platon sich richtet, ist die Dialektik der Eleaten und ihr Satz, der in seiner Art auch Satz der Sophisten ist, nÃ¤mlich der: Â»Es ist nur das Sein, und das Nichtsein ist gar nicht.Â« Dies heiÃŸt nun bei den Sophisten, wie dies Platon angibt: Da das Negative gar nicht ist, sondern nur das Seiende, so gibt es nichts Falsches; alles ist; was nicht ist, wissen, empfinden wir nicht; alles Seiende ist wahr. Damit hÃ¤ngt sophistisch zusammen: Was wir empfinden, uns vorstellen, die Zwecke, die wir uns geben, sind affirmativer Inhalt; es ist alles Wahres, was fÃ¼r uns ist, nichts ein Falsches. Platon wirft den Sophisten vor, daÃŸ sie den Unterschied von wahr und falsch aufgehoben haben, indem sie sagen, es gibt nichts Falsches; und den Sophisten ist so alles richtig. (Platon hat also das Interesse, das Nichtsein als wesentliche Bestimmung des Seienden aufzuzeigen: Â»Alles ist, sowohl das Allgemeine als [das] Einzelne ist auf vielfache Weise und ist nicht auf vielfache Weise.Â«) Die hÃ¶here Ausbildung (denn es ist nur der Unterschied der verschiedenen Stufen des BewuÃŸtseins geblieben) gibt so das, was die Sophisten zu geben versprechen: daÃŸ nÃ¤mlich alles, was das Individuum sich nach seinen Zwecken vorsetzt, nach seinem Glauben, seiner Meinung sich zum Zweck macht, affirmativ wahr, richtig sei. Man kann hiernach nicht sagen, dies ist Unrecht, lasterhaft, ein Verbrechen; denn dies drÃ¼ckt aus, daÃŸ die Maxime, die Handlung falsch sei. Man kann nicht sagen, diese Meinung ist tÃ¤uschend; denn nach dem Sinne der Sophisten enthÃ¤lt der Satz dies, daÃŸ jeder Zweck, jedes Interesse, insofern es das Meinige ist, affirmativ, mithin wahr und richtig ist. Der Satz an sich sieht ganz abstrakt und unschuldig aus; aber man merkt erst, was man an solchen Abstraktionen hat, wenn man sie in konkreter Gestalt sieht. Nach diesem unschuldigen Satze gibt es kein Laster, kein Verbrechen usf. Die Platonische Dialektik unterscheidet sich wesentlich von dieser Weise der Dialektik.

> Das NÃ¤here im Sinne des Platon ist, daÃŸ die Idee, das an und fÃ¼r sich Allgemeine, Gute, Wahre, SchÃ¶ne fÃ¼r sich selbst zu nehmen ist. Der Mythus, den ich bereits angefÃ¼hrt, geht schon dahin, daÃŸ man nicht betrachten mÃ¼sse eine gute Handlung, einen schÃ¶nen Menschen, nicht das Subjekt, wovon solche Bestimmungen die PrÃ¤dikate sind; sondern das, was in solchen Vorstellungen oder Anschauungen nun als PrÃ¤dikate auftritt, mÃ¼sse fÃ¼r sich genommen werden, und dies sei das Wahrhafte an und fÃ¼r sich. Dies hÃ¤ngt mit der Weise der Dialektik zusammen, die angefÃ¼hrt ist. Eine Handlung nach der empirischen Vorstellung genommen, kann man sagen, ist gerecht; nach einer anderen Seite kann man an ihr auch entgegengesetzte Bestimmungen aufweisen. Aber es ist ohne solche IndividualitÃ¤ten, ohne solche empirisch Konkrete, das Gute, Wahre fÃ¼r sich zu nehmen; und dies ist allein das, was ist. Die Seele, nach dem gÃ¶ttlichen Schauspiel in die Materie gefallen, freut sich Ã¼ber einen schÃ¶nen, gerechten Gegenstand; das Wahrhafte ist aber die Tugend, Gerechtigkeit, SchÃ¶nheit an und fÃ¼r sich, dies nur ist das Wahre. Das Allgemeine fÃ¼r sich, â€“ dies ist es, was durch die Platonische Dialektik nÃ¤her bestimmt wird. Hiervon kommen mehrere Formen vor; aber diese Formen sind selbst noch sehr allgemein und abstrakt. Die hÃ¶chste Form bei Platon ist die IdentitÃ¤t des Seins und Nichtseins: Das Wahrhafte ist das Seiende, aber dies Seiende ist nicht ohne die Negation. Platon zeigt so auf, daÃŸ das Nichtsein ist und daÃŸ das Einfache, Sichselbstgleiche teilhat an dem Anderssein, die Einheit teilhat an der Vielheit. Diese Einheit des Seins und Nichtseins findet sich nun auch in der Vorstellung der Sophisten; aber dies allein macht es noch nicht aus. Sondern in weiterer Untersuchung kommt Platon dann zu diesem Resultate, daÃŸ das Nichtsein nÃ¤her bestimmt die Natur des Anderen ist (Einheit, IdentitÃ¤t mit sich, â€“ und Unterschied); daÃŸ die _genÃª_ â€“ die Allgemeinheiten, eben die er sonst _ideai_ nennt â€“ vermischt, synthesiert sind (Einheit des Seins und Nichtseins, und zugleich Nichteinheit) und daÃŸ das Sein und das Andere durch alles und durch einander hindurchgeht ( _dielÃªlythota_ ); daÃŸ das Andere teilhat ( _metaschon_ ) an dem Sein, inwohnt und durch dieses Inwohnen nicht dasselbe ist mit dem, welchem es inwohnt, sondern ein Verschiedenes, â€“ und als das Andere des Seins ist es notwendig das Nichtsein. Da das Sein dem Anderen ( _thaterou_ ) inwohnt, so ist es nicht dasselbe mit den anderen Gattungen und ist nicht eine jede derselben; so daÃŸ es in den unendlich Vielen nicht selbst als ein unendlich Vieles ( _Geteiltes_ ) ist. â€“ Platon spricht es so aus: das, was das Andere ist, ist das Negative Ã¼berhaupt, â€“ dies ist Dasselbe, das mit sich Identische; das Andere ist das Nichtidentische, und dies Dasselbe ist ebenso das Andere, und zwar in ein und derselben RÃ¼cksicht. Es sind nicht verschiedene Seiten, nicht im Widerspruch bleibend; sondern sie sind diese Einheit in einer und derselben RÃ¼cksicht, und nach der einen Seite, daÃŸ das Eine von ihnen gesetzt ist, sind sie identisch nach derselben Seite. Dies ist die Hauptbestimmung der eigentÃ¼mlichen Dialektik Platons.

> DaÃŸ die Idee des GÃ¶ttlichen, Ewigen, SchÃ¶nen das AnundfÃ¼rsichseiende ist, ist der Anfang der Erhebung des BewuÃŸtseins ins Geistige und in das BewuÃŸtsein, daÃŸ das Allgemeine wahrhaft ist. FÃ¼r die Vorstellung kann es genÃ¼gen, sich zu begeistern, zu befriedigen durch die Vorstellung des SchÃ¶nen, Guten; aber das Denken, das denkende Erkennen fragt nach der Bestimmung des Ewigen, GÃ¶ttlichen. Und diese Bestimmung ist wesentlich nur freie Bestimmung, Bestimmung, die schlechthin die Allgemeinheit nicht aufhÃ¤lt, -eine Begrenzung (denn jede Bestimmung ist Begrenzung), die ebenso das Allgemeine in seiner Unendlichkeit frei fÃ¼r sich lÃ¤ÃŸt. Die Freiheit ist nur in der RÃ¼ckkehr in sich, das Ununterschiedene ist das Leblose; das tÃ¤tige, lebendige, konkrete Allgemeine ist daher das, was sich in sich unterscheidet, aber frei darin bleibt. Diese Bestimmtheit besteht nun darin, daÃŸ das Eine in dem Anderen, in den Vielen, Unterschiedenen identisch mit sich ist. Dies macht das Wahrhafte, allein Wahrhafte und fÃ¼r das Erkennen allein Interessante aus in dem, was Platonische Philosophie heiÃŸt; und weiÃŸ man dies nicht, so weiÃŸ man die Hauptsache nicht. Der Ausdruck Platons ist: das, was das Andere ist, ist Dasselbe, ist das mit sich Identische; das Andere, das nicht mit sich Identische, ist auch Dasselbe; das Sichselbstgleiche ist auch das Andere, und zwar in ein und derselben Beziehung. Diese Einheit ist nicht darin, wenn man z.B. sagt: Ich, oder Sokrates bin einer. Jeder ist einer, aber er ist auch ein Vieles, hat viele Glieder, Organe, Eigenschaften usf.; er ist einer und auch vieles. So sagt man wohl beides von Sokrates, daÃŸ er einer sei, in sich selbst gleich, und auch das Andere, Vieles, in sich ungleich. Dies ist eine Einsicht, ein Ausdruck, der im gewÃ¶hnlichsten BewuÃŸtsein vorkommt. Man nimmt es so an: er ist einer, nach anderer RÃ¼cksicht auch ein Vieles; und man lÃ¤ÃŸt so die zwei Gedanken auseinanderfallen. Das spekulative Denken aber besteht darin, daÃŸ man die Gedanken zusammenbringt; man muÃŸ sie zusammenbringen; das ist es, worauf es ankommt. Dies Zusammenbringen der Verschiedenen, Sein und Nichtsein, Eins und Vieles usf., so daÃŸ nicht bloÃŸ von einem zum anderen Ã¼bergegangen wird, â€“ dies ist das Innerste und das wahrhaft GroÃŸe der Platonischen Philosophie. Jedoch nicht in allen Dialogen kommt Platon auf diese Bestimmung; besonders ist dieser hÃ¶here Sinn in dem Philebos und Parmenides enthalten (bei Tennemann gar nicht davon die Rede). Es ist das Esoterische der Platonischen Philosophie, das andere ist das Exoterische; aber das ist schlechter Unterschied. Man muÃŸ nicht etwa den Unterschied machen, als ob Platon zwei solche Philosophien hÃ¤tte: eine fÃ¼r die Welt, fÃ¼r die Leute; die andere, das Innere, aufgespart fÃ¼r Vertraute. Das Esoterische ist das Spekulative, das geschrieben und gedruckt ist und doch ein Verborgenes bleibt fÃ¼r die, die nicht das Interesse haben, sich anzustrengen. Ein Geheimnis ist es nicht, und doch verborgen. Zu diesem gehÃ¶ren also jene beiden Dialoge.

> Im Philebos untersucht Platon die Natur des VergnÃ¼gens. Den ersten Gegenstand, das sinnliche VergnÃ¼gen, bestimmt er als das Unendliche. FÃ¼r die Reflexion ist das Unendliche das Vornehme, HÃ¶chste; aber das Unendliche ist eben das Unbestimmte an sich Ã¼berhaupt. Es kann bestimmt sein zwar auf mannigfaltige Weise; dies Bestimmte ist aber dann als einzeln, ist das Besondere. Unter VergnÃ¼gen stellen wir uns nun vor das unmittelbar Einzelne, Sinnliche; aber es ist das Unbestimmte in der RÃ¼cksicht, daÃŸ es das bloÃŸ Elementarische, wie Feuer, Wasser, nicht das Sichselbstbestimmende ist. Nur die Idee ist das Sichselbstbestimmen, die IdentitÃ¤t mit sich. Dem VergnÃ¼gen, als dem Unbestimmten, stellt Platon gegenÃ¼ber das Begrenzende, die Grenze. Im Philebos handelt es sich dann besonders um diesen Gegensatz des Unendlichen und Endlichen, Unbegrenzten und Begrenzenden ( _peras_ , _apeiron_ ). Stellen wir uns dies vor, so denken wir nicht daran, daÃŸ durch die Erkenntnis der Natur des Unendlichen, Unbestimmten zugleich auch entschieden wird Ã¼ber das VergnÃ¼gen; dies erscheint als einzeln, sinnlich, endlich, wÃ¤hrend jenes das Metaphysische ist. Aber diese reinen Gedanken sind das Substantielle, wodurch Ã¼ber alles noch so Konkrete, noch so Fernliegende entschieden wird. Wenn Platon vom VergnÃ¼gen und der Weisheit gegenÃ¼ber handelt, so ist es der Gegensatz des Endlichen und Unendlichen. _Peras_ , die Grenze, ist das Schlechtere, wie es scheint, als das _apeiron_ . Alte Philosophen bestimmten es auch so. Bei Platon ist es umgekehrt; es wird dargetan, daÃŸ das _peras_ das Wahre sei. Das Unbegrenzte ist noch abstrakt, hÃ¶her ist das Begrenzte, das Sichselbstbestimmende, Begrenzende. VergnÃ¼gen ist das Unbegrenzte ( _aperanton_ ), das sich nicht bestimmt; nur der _nous_ ist das tÃ¤tige Bestimmen. Das Unendliche ist das Unbestimmte, was eines Mehr oder Weniger fÃ¤hig ist, was intensiver sein kann oder nicht, kÃ¤lter, wÃ¤rmer, trockener, feuchter usf. Das Endliche ist dagegen die Grenze, die Proportion, das MaÃŸ, â€“ die immanente freie Bestimmung, mit der und in der die Freiheit bleibt, sich die Freiheit zugleich Existenz gibt. Die Weisheit ist, als das _peras_ , die wahrhafte Ursache, woraus das VorzÃ¼gliche entstehe; dieses MaÃŸ und Ziel Setzende ist der Zweck an und fÃ¼r sich und das Zweckbestimmende.


> Platon betrachtet dies weiter (das Unendliche ist das, an sich zum Endlichen Ã¼berzugehen, was der Materie bedarf, um sich zu realisieren, â€“ oder das Endliche, indem es sich setzt, so ist es ein Unterschiedenes, ist ein Anderes, als das Begrenzte ist; das Unendliche ist das Formlose; die freie Form als TÃ¤tigkeit ist das Endliche). Durch die Einheit dieser beiden entsteht nun z.B. Gesundheit, WÃ¤rme, KÃ¤lte, Trockenheit, Feuchtigkeit, ebenso die Harmonie der Musik von hohen und tiefen TÃ¶nen, von schnellerer und langsamerer Bewegung, Ã¼berhaupt entsteht alles SchÃ¶ne und Vollkommene durch die Einheit solcher GegensÃ¤tze. Gesundheit, SchÃ¶nheit usf. ist so ein Erzeugtes, insofern dazu die GegensÃ¤tze verwandt sind; es erscheint so als ein Vermischtes von diesen. Statt der IndividualitÃ¤t gebrauchen die Alten hÃ¤ufig: Vermischung, Teilnahme usf. FÃ¼r uns sind dies unbestimmte, ungenaue AusdrÃ¼cke. Also die Gesundheit, GlÃ¼ckseligkeit, SchÃ¶nheit usf. erscheint als ein Entstandenes durch die Verbindung solcher GegensÃ¤tze. Aber Platon sagt: Das, was so erzeugt wird, setzt voraus ein solches, wodurch das Dritte gemacht wird, die Ursache; dies ist vortrefflicher als die, durch deren Wirksamkeit ein solches entsteht. So haben wir vier Bestimmungen: erstens das Unbegrenzte, Unbestimmte; zweitens das Begrenzte, MaÃŸ, Bestimmung, Grenze, wozu die Weisheit gehÃ¶rt; das Dritte ist das Gemischte aus beiden, das nur Entstandene; das Vierte ist die Ursache, und diese ist an ihr eben die Einheit der Unterschiedenen, die SubjektivitÃ¤t, Macht, Gewalt Ã¼ber die GegensÃ¤tze, das die Kraft hat, die GegensÃ¤tze in sich zu ertragen. Das MÃ¤chtige, KrÃ¤ftige, Geistige ist das, was den Gegensatz in sich ertragen kann; der Geist kann den hÃ¶chsten Widerspruch ertragen, â€“ das schwache KÃ¶rperliche nicht, es vergeht, sobald ein Anderes an dasselbe kommt. Diese Ursache ist nun der _nous_, der der Welt vorsteht; die SchÃ¶nheit der Welt in Luft, Feuer, Wasser und allgemein in den Lebendigen ist durch ihn hervorgekommen. Das Absolute ist also das, was in einer Einheit endlich und unendlich ist.

> {#ParmenidesDialogue} Die ausgefÃ¼hrte eigentliche Dialektik aber ist im [[Parmenides]] enthalten, dem berÃ¼hmtesten MeisterstÃ¼ck der Platonischen Dialektik. Parmenides und Zenon werden da vorgestellt, als mit Sokrates zusammenkommend in Athen; die Hauptsache aber ist die Dialektik, die dem Parmenides und Zenon in den Mund gelegt wird. Gleich anfangs ist die Natur dieser Dialektik auf folgende Weise nÃ¤her angegeben. Platon lÃ¤ÃŸt Parmenides so den Sokrates loben: Â»Ich bemerkte, daÃŸ du mit AristotelesÂ« (einem der anwesenden Unterredner; es paÃŸte wohl auf den Philosophen, aber dieser ist 16 Jahre nach Sokrates' Tode geboren) Â»dich unterredetest, Ã¼berhaupt dich Ã¼bst, zu bestimmen ( _horizesthai_ ), worin die Natur des SchÃ¶nen, des Gerechten, des Guten und einer jeden dieser Ideen liegt. Dieser dein Trieb (und GeschÃ¤ft, _hormÃª_ ) ist schÃ¶n und gÃ¶ttlich. Ziehe dich aber und Ã¼be dich noch mehr in dieser unnÃ¼tz scheinenden und von der Menge so genanntenÂ« (metaphysischen) Â»Zungendrescherei ( _adoleschias_ , GeschwÃ¤tz), solange du noch jung bist; sonst wird dir die Wahrheit entgehen. â€“ WorinÂ«, fragt Sokrates, Â»besteht diese Art von Ãœbung. â€“ Es gefiel mir schon an dir, daÃŸ du vorhin sagtest, man mÃ¼sse nicht sich bei Betrachtung des Sinnlichen und seiner TÃ¤uschungen aufhalten, sondern das betrachten, was nur das Denken erfaÃŸt und was allein ist.Â« Schon frÃ¼her habe ich bemerkt, daÃŸ die Menschen von jeher geglaubt haben, das Wahre kÃ¶nne nur durch das Nachdenken gefunden werden; beim Nachdenken findet man den Gedanken, verwandelt das, was man in der Weise der Vorstellung, des Glaubens vor sich hat, in Gedanken. Sokrates erwidert nun dem Parmenides: Â»So glaubte ich, das Gleiche und Ungleiche und die anderen allgemeinen Bestimmungen der Dinge am besten einzusehen.Â« â€“ Parmenides antwortet: Â»Wohl! Aber du muÃŸt, wenn du von einer solchen BestimmungÂ« (die Ã„hnlichkeit, Gleichheit) Â»anfÃ¤ngst, nicht nur das betrachten, was aus einer solchen Voraussetzung folgt; sondern du muÃŸt auch noch dies hinzufÃ¼gen, was folgt, wenn du das Gegenteil einer solchen Bestimmung voraussetzest. Z.B. bei der Voraussetzung: das Viele ist, hast du zu untersuchen: was geschieht dem Vielen in Beziehung auf sich selbst und in Beziehung auf das EineÂ« (es wird so das Umgekehrte seiner selbst geworden sein; das Viele schlÃ¤gt um in das Eine, indem es betrachtet wird in der Bestimmung, in der es betrachtet werden soll, und dies ist das Wunderbare, was einem beim Denken begegnet, wenn man sich solche Bestimmungen fÃ¼r sich vornimmt); Â»und ebenso: was geschieht dem Eins in Beziehung auf sich und in Beziehung auf das Viele.Â« Dies ist zu betrachten. Â»Aber wiederum ist zu betrachten: wenn das Viele nicht ist, was erfolgt dann fÃ¼r das Eine und fÃ¼r das Viele, beide fÃ¼r sich und gegeneinander. Eben solche Betrachtungen sind anzustellen in betreff der IdentitÃ¤t und NichtidentitÃ¤t, der Ruhe und Bewegung, des Entstehens und Vergehens, und ebenso in Ansehung des Seins selbst und des Nichtseins: was ist jedes fÃ¼r sich und was die Beziehung bei der Annahme des einen oder des anderen? Darin dich vollkommen Ã¼bend, wirst du die wesentliche Wahrheit erkennen.Â« So groÃŸen Wert legt Platon auf die dialektische Betrachtung. Es ist nicht Betrachtung des Ã„uÃŸerlichen, sondern nur Betrachtung dessen, was als Bestimmung gelten soll. Es sind dies also die reinen Gedanken, sie sind der Inhalt; ihre Betrachtung ist lebendig, sie sind nicht tot, bewegen sich. Und die Bewegung der reinen Gedanken ist, daÃŸ sie sich zum Anderen ihrer selbst machen und so zeigen, daÃŸ nur ihre Einheit das wahrhaft Berechtigte ist.

> Ãœber den Sinn der Einheit des Einen und Vielen lÃ¤ÃŸt Platon den Sokrates sagen: Â»Wenn einer mir beweist, daÃŸ ich Eines und Vieles sei, so verwundert er mich nicht. Indem er mich nÃ¤mlich zeigt, daÃŸ ich ein Vieles sei, und an mir die rechte Seite, linke, oben und unten, vorn und hinten aufzeigt, so wohnt mir die Vielheit bei, â€“ und wiederum die Einheit, da ich von uns Sieben einer bin. Ebenso Stein und Holz usf. Aber das wÃ¼rde ich bewundern, wenn einer die Ideen zuerst, wie Gleichheit und Ungleichheit, Vielheit und Einheit, Ruhe und Bewegung und dergleichen, jede fÃ¼r sich ( _auta kath' hauta_ ) bestimmte und dann zeigte, wie sie sich an ihnen selbst identisch setzten und unterschieden.Â«

> Das Resultat (Ganze) solcher Untersuchung im Parmenides ist nun am Ende so zusammengefaÃŸt Â»DaÃŸ das Eine, es sei oder es sei nicht, es selbst sowohl als die anderen IdeenÂ« (Sein, Erscheinen, Werden, Ruhe, Bewegung, Entstehen, Vergehen usf.) Â»sowohl fÃ¼r sich selbst als in Beziehung aufeinander, â€“ alles durchaus sowohl ist als nicht ist, erscheint und nicht erscheint.Â« Dies Resultat kann sonderbar erscheinen. Wir sind nach unserer gewÃ¶hnlichen Vorstellung sehr entfernt, diese ganz abstrakten Bestimmungen, das Eine, Sein, Nichtsein, Erscheinen, Ruhe, Bewegung usf. und dergleichen, fÃ¼r Ideen zu nehmen; aber diese ganz Allgemeinen nimmt Platon als Ideen. Dieser Dialog ist eigentlich die reine Ideenlehre Platons. Platon zeigt von dem Einen, daÃŸ $[$ es $]$, wenn es ist, ebensowohl als wenn es nicht ist, als sich selbst  gleich und nicht sich selbst gleich, sowie als Bewegung wie auch als Ruhe, Entstehen und Vergehen ist und nicht ist, -oder die Einheit ebensowohl wie alle diese reinen Ideen sowohl sind als nicht sind, das Eine ebensosehr Eines als Vieles ist. In dem Satze Â»das Eine istÂ« liegt auch, Â»das Eine ist nicht Eines, sondern VielesÂ«; und umgekehrt, Â»das Viele istÂ« sagt zugleich, Â»das Viele ist nicht Vieles, sondern EinesÂ«. Sie zeigen sich dialektisch, sind wesentlich die IdentitÃ¤t mit ihrem Anderen; und das ist das Wahrhafte. Ein Beispiel gibt das Werden: Im Werden ist Sein und Nichtsein; das Wahrhafte beider ist das Werden, es ist die Einheit beider als untrennbar und doch auch als Unterschiedener; denn Sein ist nicht Werden und Nichtsein auch nicht.

> Dieses Resultat erscheint uns hiernach negativer Art zu sein, so daÃŸ dasselbe â€“ als wahrhaft Erstes, prius â€“ nicht als affirmativ ist, nicht als Negation der Negation, diese Affirmation ist hier nicht ausgesprochen. Es kann uns dies Resultat im Parmenides vielleicht nicht befriedigen. Indessen sehen die Neuplatoniker, besonders Proklos, gerade diese AusfÃ¼hrung im Parmenides fÃ¼r die wahrhafte Theologie an, fÃ¼r die wahrhafte EnthÃ¼llung aller Mysterien des gÃ¶ttlichen Wesens. Und sie kann fÃ¼r nichts anderes genommen werden. (Es sieht nicht so aus, als ob es dies wÃ¤re; Tiedemann sagt, es sei keine Rede davon, lauter neuplatonische SchwÃ¤rmerei.) Denn unter Gott verstehen wir das absolute Wesen aller Dinge; dies absolute Wesen ist eben in seinem einfachen Begriffe die Einheit und Bewegung dieser reinen Wesenheiten, der Ideen des Einen und Vielen usf. Das gÃ¶ttliche Wesen ist die Idee Ã¼berhaupt, wie sie entweder fÃ¼r das sinnliche BewuÃŸtsein oder fÃ¼r den Verstand, fÃ¼r das Denken ist. Insofern die Idee das absolute Sich-selbst-Denkende ist, ist sie die TÃ¤tigkeit des Denkens in sich; und die Dialektik ist ebenso nichts anderes als die TÃ¤tigkeit des Sich-selbst-Denkens in sich selbst. Diesen Zusammenhang sehen die Neuplatoniker nur als metaphysisch an und haben daraus[ die Theologie, die Entwicklung der Geheimnisse des gÃ¶ttlichen Wesens erkannt.

> Aber es tritt hier die schon bemerkte Zweideutigkeit, die hier bestimmter aufzuklÃ¤ren, ein: daÃŸ unter Gott und unter dem Wesen der Dinge zweierlei verstanden werden kann. Î±) Wenn nÃ¤mlich gesagt wird Â»Wesen der DingeÂ«, und dies als die Einheit, welche ebenso unmittelbar Vielheit ist, Sein ebenso unmittelbar Nichtsein, Geschehen, Bewegung ebensofort, so scheint damit nur das unmittelbare Wesen dieser unmittelbar gegenstÃ¤ndlichen Dinge bestimmt zu sein und diese Wesenlehre oder Ontologie uns noch von der Erkenntnis Gottes, von der Theologie verschieden zu sein. Diese einfachen Wesenheiten und ihre Beziehung und Bewegung scheinen nur Momente des GegenstÃ¤ndlichen auszudrÃ¼cken (sie selbst sind einfach und unmittelbar), nicht den Geist; dies darum, weil, so gedacht, ein Moment fehlt, das wir bei Gott denken. Aber der Geist, das wahrhaft absolute Wesen, ist nicht nur das Einfache und Unmittelbare Ã¼berhaupt sondern das sich in sich Reflektierende, fÃ¼r welches in seinem Gegensatze die Einheit seiner und des Entgegengesetzten ist; als solches aber stellen jene Momente und ihre Bewegung es nicht dar, â€“ jene erscheinen unreflektiert.

> Î²) Wenn diese einfachen Abstraktionen auf einer Seite als einfache Wesenheiten genommen werden, die unmittelbar sind und denen die Reflexion-in-sich fehlt, so kÃ¶nnen sie auf der andern Seite auch als reine Begriffe, rein der Reflexion in sich selbst angehÃ¶rend genommen werden. Es fehlt ihnen die RealitÃ¤t; und dann gilt ihre Bewegung fÃ¼r ein leeres Herumtreiben in leeren Abstraktionen, die nur der Reflexion angehÃ¶ren, aber keine RealitÃ¤t haben. Wir mÃ¼ssen die Natur des Erkennens und Wissens kennen, um im Begriffe alles zu haben, was darin ist. Aber wir mÃ¼ssen dies BewuÃŸtsein haben, daÃŸ eben der Begriff weder nur das Unmittelbare in Wahrheit (ob er schon das Einfache ist, â€“ aber er ist von geistiger Einfachheit, wesentlich der in sich zurÃ¼ckgekehrte Gedanke; unmittelbar ist nur dies Rote usf.), noch daÃŸ er nur das in sich sich Reflektierende, das Ding des BewuÃŸtseins ist, sondern auch an sich ist, d.h. gegenstÃ¤ndliches Wesen ist. Einfachheit ist Unmittelbarkeit, Ansichsein, ist so alle RealitÃ¤t. Dies BewuÃŸtsein Ã¼ber die Natur des Begriffs hat Platon nun nicht so bestimmt ausgesprochen und damit auch dies nicht, daÃŸ dies Wesen der Dinge dasselbe ist, was das gÃ¶ttliche Wesen. Zum gÃ¶ttlichen Wesen erfordern wir eben fÃ¼r das Wesen oder Sein diese Reflexion in sich selbst, fÃ¼r die Reflexion-in-sich das Sein oder Wesen. Es ist aber eigentlich nur mit dem Worte nicht ausgesprochen; denn die Sache ist allerdings vorhanden. Der Unterschied des Sprechens ist nur als nach der Weise der Vorstellung und des Begriffs vorhanden.

> Einesteils nun ist diese Reflexion-in-sich, das Geistige, der Begriff, in der Spekulation des Platon vorhanden. Denn die Einheit des Vielen und Einen usf. ist eben diese IndividualitÃ¤t in der Differenz, dies InsichzurÃ¼ckgekehrtsein in seinem Gegenteile, dies Gegenteil, das in sich selbst ist. Das Wesen der Welt ist wesentlich diese in sich zurÃ¼ckkehrende Bewegung des InsichzurÃ¼ckgekehrten.
Andernteils aber bleibt eben darum bei Platon noch dies Insichreflektiertsein als Gott nach der Weise der Vorstellung ein davon Getrenntes; und in seiner Darstellung des Werdens der Natur im Timaios erscheint so als ein Unterschiedenes Gott und das Wesen der Dinge. Dies Wesen der Welt werden wir nÃ¤her in der Platonischen Naturphilosophie kennenlernen.

> Die Dialektik des Platon ist jedoch nicht nach jeder RÃ¼cksicht als vollendet anzuerkennen. Es ist besonders in ihr darum zu tun, aufzuzeigen, daÃŸ, indem man z.B. nur das Eine setzt, in ihm selbst enthalten ist die Bestimmung der Vielheit oder daÃŸ in dem Vielen die Bestimmung der Einheit ist, indem wir es betrachten. Man kann nicht sagen, daÃŸ in allen dialektischen Bewegungen des Platon diese strenge Weise enthalten ist, sondern es sind oft Ã¤uÃŸere Betrachtungen, die in seiner Dialektik EinfluÃŸ haben. Z.B. sagt Parmenides: Â»Das Eine ist; es folgt hieraus, daÃŸ das Eine nicht gleichbedeutend ist mit Ist, so daÃŸ also das Eine und Ist unterschieden sind. Es ist also in dem Satze: Das Eine ist, der Unterschied; so ist das Viele darin, und so sage ich mit dem Einen schon das Viele.Â« Diese Dialektik ist zwar richtig, aber nicht ganz rein, indem sie von solcher Verbindung zweier Bestimmungen anfÃ¤ngt.

> Wenn Platon vom Guten, SchÃ¶nen spricht, so sind dies konkrete Ideen. Es ist aber nur eine Idee. Bis zu solchen konkreten Ideen hat es noch weit hin, wenn man von solchen Abstraktionen anfÃ¤ngt als Sein, Nichtsein, Einheit, Vielheit. Dieses hat Platon nicht geleistet: diese abstrakten Gedanken fortzufÃ¼hren zur SchÃ¶nheit, Wahrheit, Sittlichkeit; diese Entwicklung, Verpilzung fehlt. Aber schon in der Erkenntnis jener abstrakten Bestimmungen selbst liegt wenigstens das Kriterium, die Quelle fÃ¼r das Konkrete. Im Philebos wird so das Prinzip der Empfindung, Lust betrachtet; das ist schon konkret. Die alten Philosophen wuÃŸten ganz wohl, was sie an solchen abstrakten Gedanken hatten fÃ¼r das Konkrete. Im atomistischen Prinzip der Einheit, Vielheit finden wir so die Quelle einer Konstruktion des Staats; die letzte Gedankenbestimmung solcher Staatsprinzipien ist eben das Logische. Die Alten hatten bei solchem reinen Philosophieren nicht solchen Zweck wie wir, â€“ Ã¼berhaupt nicht so den Zweck metaphysischer Konsequenz, gleichsam nicht als Zweck, nicht als Problem vorgelegt. Wir haben konkrete Gestaltung, Stoff, wollen es mit diesem Stoff in Richtigkeit bringen. Bei Platon enthÃ¤lt die Philosophie die Richtung, welche das Individuum sich geben soll, dies und dies zu erkennen; aber Ã¼berhaupt setzt Platon die absolute GlÃ¼ckseligkeit fÃ¼r sich, das selige Leben selbst in die Betrachtung (im Leben) jener gÃ¶ttlichen GegenstÃ¤nde. Dieses Leben ist betrachtend, scheint zwecklos, alle Interessen sind verschwunden. Im Reiche des Gedankens frei zu leben, ist fÃ¼r die Alten Zweck an und fÃ¼r sich selbst gewesen; und sie erkannten, daÃŸ nur im Gedanken Freiheit sei. Bei Platon fing es auch an, sich weiter zu bemÃ¼hen, um das Bestimmtere zu erkennen; der allgemeine Stoff des Erkennens fing an, sich mehr abzusondern. Wir finden Dialoge, die sich mit dem reinen Gedanken beschÃ¤ftigen; im Timaios finden wir Naturphilosophie, in der Republik Ethik.


###### 2. Natural philosophy
 {#PlatoNaturalPhilosophy}

> Im Timaios tritt die Idee in ihrer Bestimmtheit nÃ¤her ausgedrÃ¼ckt hervor; die Grundbestimmungen von der Naturphilosophie des Platon sind im Timaios enthalten. Allein auf das NÃ¤here, Spezielle kÃ¶nnen wir uns nicht einlassen; es hat indessen auch wenig Interesse. Von den Pythagoreern hat Platon viel aufgenommen; wieviel ihnen angehÃ¶re, ist nicht genau zu beurteilen. Der Timaios ist ohne Zweifel die Umarbeitung eines eigentlich von einem Pythagoreer verfaÃŸten Werks. Andere haben auch gesagt, dies sei nur ein Auszug, den ein Pythagoreer gemacht habe aus dem grÃ¶ÃŸeren Werke Platons. Aber das erste ist das Wahrscheinlichere. Der Timaios hat zu allen Zeiten fÃ¼r den schwersten und dunkelsten unter den Platonischen Dialogen gegolten. (Besonders, wo er auf Physiologie hinausgeht, entspricht das Vorgetragene unseren Kenntnissen gar nicht, wenn wir auch Platons treffliche, von den Neueren nur zu sehr verkannte Blicke bewundern mÃ¼ssen.) Diese Schwierigkeit ist Î±) teils die Ã¤uÃŸere schon bemerkte Vermischung des begreifenden Erkennens und Vorstellens, wie wir gleich pythagoreische Zahlen eingemischt sehen werden, Î²) vorzÃ¼glich aber die philosophische Beschaffenheit der Sache selbst, Ã¼ber die Platon noch kein BewuÃŸtsein hatte. Diese andere Schwierigkeit ist die Anordnung des Ganzen. Was nÃ¤mlich sogleich daran auffÃ¤llt, ist, daÃŸ Platon mehrmals sich unterbricht, oft umzukehren und wieder von vorne anzufangen scheint.

> Dies hat Kritiker, z.B. selbst $[$ F. A. $]$ Wolf in Halle und andere, die es nicht philosophisch zu nehmen wissen, bewogen, es fÃ¼r eine Sammlung und Zusammenstellung von Fragmenten oder mehreren Werken zu nehmen, die nur Ã¤uÃŸerlich so zusammengeheftet worden oder wo in das Platonische vieles Fremde eingeschoben worden wÃ¤re. (Wolf meinte in mÃ¼ndlichen Unterredungen hieraus zu erkennen, daÃŸ dieser Dialog, gleich wie sein Homer, aus verschiedenen StÃ¼cken zusammengesetzt sei.) Allein obzwar der Zusammenhang unmethodisch erscheint, Platon selbst dieser Verwechslung wegen gleichsam hÃ¤ufig seine Entschuldigungen macht, so werden wir im Ganzen sehen, wie es notwendig auseinanderfÃ¤llt und was die RÃ¼ckkehr gleichsam zum Anfang notwendig macht. (FÃ¼r diese mehrmalige RÃ¼ckkehr kann man einen tieferen Grund angeben.)

> Die Darlegung des Wesens der Natur oder des Werdens der Welt leitet Platon nun auf folgende Weise ein: Â»Gott ist das GuteÂ« ( _to agathon_ , das Gute steht an der Spitze der Platonischen Ideen, wie denn Aristoteles von den Ideen und vom Guten geschrieben hat, worin er die Platonische Lehre abgehandelt hat), Â»das Gute hat aber auf keinerlei Weise irgendeinen Neid in sich; deswegen hat er die Welt sich am Ã„hnlichsten machen wollenÂ«. Gott ist hier noch ohne Bestimmung; Platon fÃ¤ngt indessen im Timaios mehrmals so von vorne an. DaÃŸ Gott keinen Neid habe, ist allerdings ein groÃŸer, schÃ¶ner, wahrhafter, naiver Gedanke. Bei den Ã„lteren dagegen ist die Nemesis, Dike, das Schicksal, der Neid die einzige Bestimmung der GÃ¶tter, daÃŸ sie das GroÃŸe herabsetzen, kleinmachen, das WÃ¼rdige, Erhabene nicht leiden kÃ¶nnen. Die spÃ¤teren edlen Philosophen bestritten dies. In der bloÃŸen Vorstellung der Nemesis ist noch keine sittliche Bestimmung enthalten. Die Strafe, das Geltendmachen des Sittlichen gegen das Unsittliche ist eine Herabsetzung dessen, was das MaÃŸ Ã¼berschreitet; aber dies MaÃŸ ist noch nicht als das Sittliche vorgestellt. Platons Gedanke ist weit hÃ¶her als die Ansicht der meisten Neueren, welche, indem sie sagen, Gott sei ein verschlossener Gott, habe sich nicht offenbart und man wisse von Gott nicht, der Gottheit Neid zuschreiben. Denn warum sollte er sich nicht offenbaren, wenn wir einigen Ernst machen wollten mit Gott? Ein Licht verliert nichts, wenn anderes angezÃ¼ndet wird; so war Strafe in Athen auf das Nicht-Erlauben gesetzt. Wird die Erkenntnis Gottes uns verwehrt, so daÃŸ wir nur Endliches erkennen, das Unendliche nicht erreichen, so wÃ¤re er neidisch, oder Gott ist dann leerer Name. Denn sonst heiÃŸt es nichts weiter als: das HÃ¶here von Gott wollen wir auf der Seite liegen lassen und unseren kleinlichen Interessen, Ansichten usf. nachgehen. Diese Demut ist Frevel, SÃ¼nde gegen den Geist.

> Gott ist also nach Platon ohne Neid. Er fÃ¤hrt fort: Â»Er fand nun das Sichtbare vor ( _paralabÃ´n_ )Â« â€“ ein mythischer Ausdruck, aus dem BedÃ¼rfnis hervorgegangen, mit etwas Unmittelbarem anzufangen, das man aber, wie es sich so prÃ¤sentiert, durchaus nicht gelten lassen kann â€“, Â»nicht als ruhig, sondern zufÃ¤llig und unordentlich bewegt, und brachte es aus der Unordnung in die Ordnung, indem er diese fÃ¼r vortrefflicher als jene erachtete.Â« Hiernach sieht es so aus, als habe Platon angenommen, Gott sei nur der _dÃªmiourgos_ , der Ordner der Materie, und diese als ewig, selbstÃ¤ndig von ihm vorgefunden, als Chaos. Diese VerhÃ¤ltnisse sind aber nicht Philosopheme, Dogmen des Platon, es ist ihm nicht Ernst damit; dieses ist nur nach der Vorstellung gesprochen, solche AusdrÃ¼cke haben keinen philosophischen Gehalt. Es ist nur die Einleitung des Gegenstandes, um zu solchen Bestimmungen einzufÃ¼hren, wie die Materie ist. Wir mÃ¼ssen wissen, daÃŸ, wenn wir in der Philosophie mit Gott, Sein, Raum, Zeit usf. anfangen, auf unmittelbare Weise davon sprechen, dies selbst ein Inhalt ist, der seiner Natur nach unmittelbar ist, zunÃ¤chst nur unmittelbar ist; und wir mÃ¼ssen wissen, daÃŸ diese Bestimmungen als unmittelbar zugleich in sich unbestimmt sind. So ist Gott noch unbestimmt, fÃ¼r den Gedanken leer.

> Platon kommt dann in seinem Fortgange zu weiteren Bestimmungen, und diese sind erst die Idee. Wir mÃ¼ssen uns an das Spekulative Platons halten. Er sagt, Gott achtete die Ordnung fÃ¼r vortrefflicher; dies ist die Manier eines naiven Ausdrucks. Bei uns wÃ¼rde man gleich fordern, Gott erst zu beweisen; ebensowenig wÃ¼rde man das Sichtbare statuieren. Bei Platon ist dies mehr nur naive Weise; was daraus bewiesen wird, ist erst die wahrhafte Bestimmung, die Bestimmung der Idee, die erst spÃ¤ter hervorkommt. Er fÃ¤hrt fort: Gott Ã¼berlegend, daÃŸ von dem Sichtbaren (Sinnlichen) das UnverstÃ¤ndige ( _anoÃªton_ ) nicht schÃ¶ner sein kÃ¶nne als das VernÃ¼nftige, der Verstand ( _nous_ ) aber ohne Seele mit nichts teilhaben kÃ¶nne, â€“ nach diesem Schlusse setzte er den Verstand in die Seele, die Seele aber in den KÃ¶rper, weil der Verstand nicht teilnehmen kÃ¶nnte am Sichtbaren ohne KÃ¶rper, Â»und schloÃŸ sie so zusammen, daÃŸ die Welt ein beseeltes, verstÃ¤ndiges Tier geworden istÂ«. (Wir haben Ã„hnliches im Phaidros gesehen.) Wir haben RealitÃ¤t und _nous_ , â€“ und die Seele, das Band dieser beiden Extreme; dies ist das ganz Wahrhafte, Reale.

> Â»Es ist aber nur ein solches Tier. Denn wenn es zwei oder mehrere wÃ¤ren, so wÃ¤ren diese nur Teile des Einen und nur Eines.Â« 

> Nun geht Platon sogleich zuerst an die Bestimmung der Idee des kÃ¶rperlichen Wesens: Â»Weil die Welt leiblich, sichtbar und betastbar werden sollte, ohne Feuer aber nichts gesehen werden kann und ohne Festes, ohne Erde aber nichts betastet werden kann, so machte Gott im Anfang gleich das Feuer und die Erde.Â« Auf kindliche Weise fÃ¼hrt Platon diese ein. Â»Zwei allein aber kÃ¶nnen nicht ohne ein Drittes vereinigt sein, sondern es muÃŸ ein Band in der Mitte sein, das sie beide zusammenhÃ¤ltÂ« (einer der reinen AusdrÃ¼cke des Platon); Â»der Bande schÃ¶nstes aber ist, welches sich selbst und das, was von ihm zusammengehalten wird, aufs HÃ¶chste eins macht.Â« Das ist tief; da ist der Begriff, die Idee enthalten. Das Band ist das Subjektive, Individuelle, die Macht; es greift Ã¼bers Andere und macht sich mit ihm identisch. Â»Dieses bewerkstelligt die Analogie (das stetige VerhÃ¤ltnis) am schÃ¶nsten.Â« Analogie aber ist: Â»Wenn von drei Zahlen oder Massen oder KrÃ¤ften dasjenige, welches die Mitte ist, sich wie das Erste zu ihm, so es sich zum Letzten verhÃ¤lt, und umgekehrt wie das Letzte zur Mitte, so diese Mitte zum ErstenÂ« (a:b = b:c), Â»indem dann diese Mitte das Erste und Letzte geworden und das Letzte und Erste umgekehrt beide zu Mittleren, so erfolgt, daÃŸ alle nach der Notwendigkeit dasselbe sindÂ« (das ist Unterschied, der keiner ist); Â»wenn sie aber dasselbe geworden, so wird alles eins sein.Â«  Das ist vortrefflich, das behalten wir noch jetzt in der Philosophie.

> Diese Diremtion, von der Platon ausgeht, ist der SchluÃŸ, der aus dem Logischen bekannt ist. Dieser SchluÃŸ bleibt die Form, wie sie im gewÃ¶hnlichen [[syllogism|Syllogismus]] erscheint, aber als das VernÃ¼nftige. Die Unterschiede sind die Extreme, und die IdentitÃ¤t ist es, die sie zu Einem macht. Der SchluÃŸ ist das Spekulative, welches sich in den Extremen mit sich selbst zusammenschlieÃŸt, indem alle Termini alle Stellen durchlaufen. Im SchluÃŸ ist die ganze VernÃ¼nftigkeit, Idee enthalten, wenigstens Ã¤uÃŸerlich. Es ist daher Unrecht, vom SchluÃŸ schlecht zu sprechen und ihn nicht anzuerkennen als hÃ¶chste absolute Form. In Hinsicht des Verstandesschlusses hat man dagegen Recht, ihn zu verwerfen. Dieser hat keine solche Mitte; jeder der Unterschiede gilt da als selbstÃ¤ndig, verschieden in eigener selbstÃ¤ndiger Form, eine eigentÃ¼mliche Bestimmung gegen das Andere habend. Dies ist in der Platonischen Philosophie aufgehoben, und das Spekulative macht darin die eigentliche, wahrhafte Form des Schlusses aus. Die Mitte macht die Extreme aufs HÃ¶chste eins; sie bleiben nicht selbstÃ¤ndig, weder gegen sich noch gegen die Mitte. Die Mitte wird die beiden Extreme, und diese werden zur Mitte; dann er folgt erst, daÃŸ alle nach der Notwendigkeit dasselbe sind und so die Einheit konstituiert ist. Im VerstandesschluÃŸ dagegen ist diese Einheit nur die Einheit wesentlich unterschieden Gehaltener, die so bleiben; hier wird ein Subjekt, eine Bestimmung zusammengeschlossen mit einer anderen oder gar Â»ein Begriff mit einem anderenÂ« durch die Mitte. Aber die Hauptsache ist die IdentitÃ¤t, oder daÃŸ das Subjekt in der Mitte mit sich selbst zusammengeschlossen wird, nicht mit einem Anderen. Im VernunftschluÃŸ ist so vorgestellt ein Subjekt, ein Inhalt durch das Andere und im Anderen sich mit sich selbst zusammenschlieÃŸend; dies liegt darin, daÃŸ die Extreme identisch geworden sind, â€“ das eine schlieÃŸt sich mit dem anderen, aber als ihm identisch, zusammen. Dies ist mit anderen Worten die Natur Gottes. Wird Gott zum Subjekt gemacht, so ist es dies, daÃŸ er seinen Sohn, die Welt erzeugt, sich realisiert in dieser RealitÃ¤t, die als Anderes erscheint, aber darin identisch mit sich bleibt, den Abfall vernichtet und sich in dem Anderen nur mit sich selbst zusammenschlieÃŸt; so ist er erst Geist. Wenn man das Unmittelbare erhebt Ã¼ber das Vermittelte und dann sagt, Gottes Wirkung sei unmittelbar, so hat dies einen guten Grund; aber das Konkrete ist, daÃŸ Gott ein SchluÃŸ ist, der sich mit sich selbst zusammenschlieÃŸt. Das HÃ¶chste ist so in der Platonischen Philosophie enthalten. Es sind zwar nur reine Gedanken, die aber alles in sich enthalten; und in allen konkreten Formen kommt es allein auf die Gedankenbestimmungen an. Diese Formen haben seit Platon ein paar tausend Jahre brachgelegen; in die christliche Religion sind sie nicht als Gedanken Ã¼bergegangen, ja man hat sie sogar als mit Unrecht hinÃ¼bergenommene Ansichten betrachtet, bis man in neueren Zeiten angefangen hat, zu begreifen, daÃŸ Begriff, Natur und Gott in diesen Bestimmungen enthalten sind.

> Platon fÃ¤hrt nun fort: In diesem Felde des Sichtbaren waren also als Extreme Erde und Feuer, das Feste und das Belebte. Â»Weil das Feste zwei Mitten brauchtÂ« (wichtiger Gedanke; statt Drei haben wir im NatÃ¼rlichen Vier, die Mitte ist gedoppelt), Â»weil es nicht nur Breite, sondern auch Tiefe hatÂ« (eigentlich vier Dimensionen, indem der Punkt durch Linie und FlÃ¤che mit dem soliden KÃ¶rper zusammengeschlossen ist), Â»so hat Gott zwischen das Feuer und die Erde Luft und Wasser gesetztÂ« (wieder eine Bestimmung mit logischer Tiefe, da diese Mitte, als das Differente in seinem Unterschied nach den beiden Extremen hingekehrt, in sich selbst unterschieden sein muÃŸ), Â»und zwar nach einem VerhÃ¤ltnisse, so daÃŸ sich das Feuer zur Luft wie die Luft zum Wasser und ferner die Luft zum Wasser wie das Wasser zur Erde verhÃ¤lt.Â« Wir finden so eine gebrochene Mitte, und die Zahl Vier, die hier vorkommt, ist in der Natur eine Hauptgrundzahl. Die Ursache, daÃŸ das, was im vernÃ¼nftigen SchluÃŸ nur Dreiheit ist, in der Natur zur Vierheit Ã¼bergeht, liegt im NatÃ¼rlichen, indem nÃ¤mlich das, was im Gedanken unmittelbar eins ist, in der Natur auseinandertritt. Die Mitte nÃ¤mlich als Gegensatz ist eine gedoppelte. Das Eine ist Gott, das Zweite, das Vermittelnde, ist der Sohn, das Dritte ist der Geist; hier ist die Mitte einfach. Aber in der Natur ist der Gegensatz, damit er als Gegensatz existiere, selbst ein Doppeltes; so haben wir, wenn wir zÃ¤hlen, Vier. Dies findet auch bei der Vorstellung von Gott statt. Indem wir sie auf die Welt anwenden, so haben wir als Mitte die Natur und den existierenden Geist â€“ die Natur als solche und der existierende Geist, die RÃ¼ckkehr der Natur, der Weg der RÃ¼ckkehr â€“, und das ZurÃ¼ckgekehrtsein ist der Geist. Dieser lebendige ProzeÃŸ â€“ dies Unterscheiden und das Unterschiedene identisch mit sich zu setzen â€“, dies ist der lebendige Gott.

> Platon sagt weiter: Â»Durch diese Einheit ist die sichtbare und berÃ¼hrbare Welt gemacht worden. Dadurch, daÃŸ Gott ihr diese ElementeÂ« (Feuer usf. hat hier eigentlich keine Bedeutung) Â»ganz und ungeteilt gegeben hat, ist sie vollkommen, altert und erkrankt nicht. Denn Alter und Krankheit entstehen nur daraus, daÃŸ auf einen KÃ¶rper solche Elemente im ÃœbermaÃŸe von auÃŸen wirken. Dies aber ist so nicht der Fall; denn die Welt enthÃ¤lt sie selbst ganz in sich, und es kann nichts von auÃŸen kommen. Die Gestalt der Welt ist die kugeligeÂ« (wie sonst bei Parmenides und den Pythagoreern), Â»als die vollkommenste, welche alle anderen in sich enthÃ¤lt; sie ist vollkommen glatt, denn es ist fÃ¼r sie nichts nach auÃŸen, kein Unterschied gegen Anderes, sie braucht keine Glieder.Â« Die Endlichkeit besteht darin, daÃŸ ein Unterschied, eine Ã„uÃŸerlichkeit ist fÃ¼r irgendeinen Gegenstand. In der Idee ist auch die Bestimmung, das Begrenzen, Unterscheiden, das Anderssein, aber zugleich aufgelÃ¶st, enthalten, gehalten in dem Einen; so ist es ein Unterschied, wodurch keine Endlichkeit entsteht, sondern zugleich aufgehoben ist. Die Endlichkeit ist so im Unendlichen selbst; â€“ dies ist ein groÃŸer Gedanke. Â»Gott hat nun der Welt die angemessenste Bewegung von den sieben gegeben, nÃ¤mlich diejenige, welche am meisten zum Verstande und BewuÃŸtsein paÃŸt, die Kreisbewegung; die sechs anderen hat er von ihr abgesondert und sie von ihrem ungeordneten WesenÂ« (vorwÃ¤rts und rÃ¼ckwÃ¤rts) Â»befreit.Â« Dies ist nur im allgemeinen gesagt.

> Ferner: Â»Da Gott die Welt sich Ã¤hnlich, sie zum Gotte machen wollte, so hat er ihr die Seele gegeben und diese in die Mitte gesetzt und durch das Ganze ausgebreitetÂ« (Weltseele) Â»und dies auch von auÃŸen durch sie umschlossenÂ« (es ist so die Welt eine TotalitÃ¤t) Â»und auf diese Weise dies sich selbst genÃ¼gende, keines Anderen bedÃ¼rftige, sich selbst bekannte und befreundete Wesen zustande gebracht. Und so hat Gott durch alles dieses die Welt als einen seligen Gott geboren.Â« Wir kÃ¶nnen sagen: Hier hat Platon nun bestimmte Vorstellung von Gott, erst hier ist das Wahrhafte, die Erkenntnis der Idee. Aber der erste Gott ist noch unbestimmt. Wir mÃ¼ssen mit BewuÃŸtsein diesen Weg nehmen, mit BewuÃŸtsein, daÃŸ das Erste, es sei Sein oder Gott, unbestimmt ist. Dieser erzeugte Gott ist erst das Wahrhafte; jener erste ist ein Wort, â€“ angefangen nach der Weise der reinen Vorstellung zu sprechen, als bloÃŸe Hypothesis, Voraussetzung der Vorstellung. Als Gott nur das Gute war, war er nur Name, noch nicht als sich selbst bestimmend und bestimmt. Die Mitte ist also das Wahrhafte. Haben wir daher zuerst von einer Materie angefangen und wollte man danach meinen, Platon hÃ¤tte die Materie fÃ¼r selbstÃ¤ndig gehalten, so ist dies nach dem eben AngefÃ¼hrten falsch. Das AnundfÃ¼rsichseiende, das Selige ist erst dieser Gott, diese IdentitÃ¤t.


> Â»Wenn wir nun von der Seele zuletzt gesprochen haben, so ist sieÂ«, sagt Platon, Â»deswegen doch nicht das Letzte, sondern dies kommt nur unserer Sprechweise zu; sie ist das Herrschende, das KÃ¶nigliche, â€“ das KÃ¶rperliche aber, das ihr GehorchendeÂ« ist nicht das SelbstÃ¤ndige, Ewige. Das ist die NaivitÃ¤t Platons; er schreibt es der Sprechweise zu. Was hier als zufÃ¤llig erscheint, ist dann wieder notwendig: mit dem Unmittelbaren anzufangen und dann erst zum Konkreten zu kommen. Man kann also, wie bereits bemerkt ist, in solchen Darstellungen Platons WidersprÃ¼che aufzeigen; aber es kommt darauf an, was er gibt fÃ¼r das Wahrhafte. NÃ¤her wird uns die Natur der Platonischen Idee folgendes zeigen. Platon sagt nÃ¤mlich: Â»Das Wesen der Seele aber ist auf folgende Weise beschaffen worden.Â« Hier ist eigentlich wieder dieselbe Idee als bei dem Wesen des KÃ¶rperlichen. Es ist dies eine der berÃ¼hmtesten, tiefsten Stellen Platons, nÃ¤mlich: Â»Von dem ungeteilten und sich immer gleich seienden Wesen und dann von dem geteilten Wesen, welches an den KÃ¶rpern ist, hat Gott eine dritte Art von Wesen aus beiden zur Mitte vereint, welche von der Natur des Sichselbstgleichen und von der Natur des Anderen ist.Â« Das Geteilte heiÃŸt bei Platon auch das Andere als solches, â€“ nicht von irgend etwas. Â»Und hiernach hat Gott sie zur gleichen Mitte des Ungeteilten und des Geteilten gemacht.Â« Da kommen die abstrakten Bestimmungen: das Eine ist die IdentitÃ¤t, das Andere ist _to heteron_ , das Andere an ihm selbst, das Viele oder das Nicht-Identische Gegensatz, Unterschied. Sagen wir Â»Gott, das Absolute, ist die IdentitÃ¤t des Identischen und Nicht-IdentischenÂ«, so hat man Ã¼ber Barbarei, Scholastik gesprochen. Die Leute, die so darÃ¼ber sprechen, kÃ¶nnen den Platon hoch rÃ¼hmen, und doch hat er das Wahre ebenso bestimmt. Â»Und diese drei Wesen als verschieden gesetzt nehmend, hat Gott alles in eine Idee vereintÂ« (sie sind nicht drei; das Dritte ist nicht Drittes gegen die anderen), Â»indem er die Natur des Anderen, die schwer mischbar ist, mit Gewalt in das Sichselbstgleiche einpaÃŸte.Â« Dies ist allerdings die Gewalt des Begriffs, der das Viele, AuÃŸereinander, idealisiert und als Ideelles setzt. Das ist eben auch die Gewalt, die dem Verstande angetan wird, wenn man ihm so etwas proponiert. In der einfachen Reflexion-in-sich, einfachen ZurÃ¼cknahme jenes Anfangs, worin sie geschieden, sind jene Momente: das sich selbst Gleiche (selbst Moment), das Andere, â€“ das Dritte Vereinigung, aber auflÃ¶slich erscheinend, nicht in die erste Einheit zurÃ¼ckkehrend. Es ist nicht zu fragen, ob die Materie (das Andere) ewig. Â»Dies mit dem Wesen ( _ousia_ ) vermischend und aus allen Dreien Einsmachend, hat er dieses Ganze wieder in Teile, soviel als sich geziemte, ausgeteilt.Â«  Vergleichen wir diese Substanz der Seele mit der der sichtbaren Welt, so ist sie dieselbe wie diese. Und dies eine Ganze ist nun erst die jetzt systematisierte Substanz, die wahrhafte Materie oder Wesen, der absolute Stoff, der in sich geteilt ist (eine bleibende und untrennbare Einheit des Einen und des Vielen); es muÃŸ nach keiner anderen gefragt werden.

> Diese SubjektivitÃ¤t hat Platon also wieder geteilt, und die Art und Weise der Einteilung ist nach der Bestimmung der Zahlen ausgedrÃ¼ckt. Hier treten pythagoreische Vorstellungen ein. (Die KirchenvÃ¤ter haben bei Platon die Dreieinigkeit gefunden; sie wollten sie in Gedanken fassen, beweisen, aus dem Gedanken erzeugen. Das Wahre hat bei Platon also dieselbe Bestimmung als die Dreieinigkeit. Wir mÃ¼ssen uns aber bei Platon nicht an die Vorstellung halten, daÃŸ Gott vorgefunden, genommen hat, sondern wir mÃ¼ssen uns an den Begriff halten. Dieser Gott, von dem Platon spricht, ist nicht Gedanke, sondern Vorstellung.) Diese Verteilung enthÃ¤lt die berÃ¼hmten Platonischen Zahlen (wie Cicero, der nichts davon verstand, sie nennt), welche ohne Zweifel ursprÃ¼nglich den Pythagoreern angehÃ¶ren, um die sich die Ã„lteren und die Neueren, auch noch Kepler in seiner Harmonia mundi viele MÃ¼he gegeben, aber niemand sie noch eigentlich verstanden. Sie verstehen, hieÃŸe das Gedoppelte: teils ihre spekulative Bedeutung, ihren Begriff erkennen. Allein, wie schon bei den Pythagoreern angemerkt, diese Zahlenunterschiede geben nur einen unbestimmten Begriff des Unterschiedes, und nur in den ersten Zahlen; wo aber die VerhÃ¤ltnisse verwickelter werden, sind sie Ã¼berhaupt unfÃ¤hig, ihn nÃ¤her zu bezeichnen. Teils, da sie Zahlen sind, so drÃ¼cken sie als solche GrÃ¶ÃŸenunterschiede Unterschiede des Sinnlichen aus. Das System der erscheinenden GrÃ¶ÃŸe â€“ und das himmlische System ist es, worin die GrÃ¶ÃŸe am reinsten und freisten, ununterjocht von dem Qualitativen wie an allem anderen, wo sie mehr dasein muÃŸ, erscheint - mÃ¼ÃŸte ihnen entsprechen. Allein diese lebendigen ZahlensphÃ¤ren sind selbst Systeme vieler Momente: GrÃ¶ÃŸe der Entfernung, der Geschwindigkeit, auch der Masse. Kein einzelnes dieser Momente kann als eine Reihe dargestellt, mit einer Reihe einfacher Zahlen verglichen werden; denn die Reihe kann zu ihren Gliedern nur das System dieser ganzen Momente enthalten. WÃ¤ren nun die Platonischen Zahlen auch die Elemente eines jeden solchen Systems, so wÃ¤re nicht sowohl dies Element dasjenige, um das es zu tun wÃ¤re, sondern das VerhÃ¤ltnis der Momente, die sich in der Bewegung unterscheiden, was als Ganzes zu begreifen und das wahrhaft Interessante und VernÃ¼nftige ist. Wir haben kurz die Hauptsache historisch anzugeben. Die grÃ¼ndlichste Abhandlung darÃ¼ber ist von $[$ August $]$ BÃ¶ckh in den Studien von Daub und Creuzer.

> Die Grundreihe ist sehr einfach. Â»Zuerst hat Gott aus dem Ganzen einen Teil genommen; alsdann den zweiten, den doppelten des ersten; der dritte ist 1 1/2 von dem zweiten, der dreifache des ersten; der nÃ¤chste das Doppelte des zweiten; der fÃ¼nfte das Dreifache des dritten; der sechste das Achtfache des ersten; der siebente ist um 26 grÃ¶ÃŸer als der erste.Â« Die Reihe ist mithin: 1; 2; 3; dann 4, das Quadrat von 2; 9, das Quadrat von 3; 8 als kubus von 2; und 27 als kubus von 3. Â»Alsdann hat Gott die zweifachen (1 : 2) und dreifachen (1 : 3) Intervalle (VerhÃ¤ltnisse) ausgefÃ¼llt, indem er wieder Teile aus dem Ganzen abschnitt. Diese Teile hat er in die ZwischenrÃ¤ume so gestellt, daÃŸ zwei (Mittlere oder) Mitten in jedem seien, wovon die eine um den ebensovielten Teil grÃ¶ÃŸer und kleiner als jedes der Extreme, die andere aber der Anzahl nach um gleich viel grÃ¶ÃŸer und kleiner als die Extreme istÂ«, â€“ das erste ein stetiges geometrisches VerhÃ¤ltnis, das andere ein arithmetisches. Die erste Mitte entsteht durch die Quadrate (1:âˆš2:2); die andere ist z.B., wenn 1 1/2 die Mitte ist zwischen 1 und 2. Hierdurch entstehen dann neue VerhÃ¤ltnisse; diese sind wieder auf eine besondere angegebene schwierigere Weise in jene ersten eingeschoben, doch so, daÃŸ allenthalben etwas weggelassen worden. Und das letzte VerhÃ¤ltnis (horos) der Zahl zur Zahl ist 256: 243 â€“ oder 28: 35. Man kommt jedoch nicht weit mit diesen ZahlenverhÃ¤ltnissen; sie bieten nichts fÃ¼r den Begriff, fÃ¼r die Idee dar. Die VerhÃ¤ltnisse, Gesetze der Natur lassen sich nicht mit diesen dÃ¼rren Zahlen ausdrÃ¼cken. Es ist ein empirisches VerhÃ¤ltnis und macht nicht die Grundbestimmung in den MaÃŸen der Natur aus. Platon sagt nun: Â»Diese ganze Reihe hat Gott ihrer LÃ¤nge nach in zwei Teile zerschnitten, sie kreuzweise Ã¼bereinandergelegt, ihre Enden umgebogen zu einem Kreise und sie mit einer gleichfÃ¶rmigen Bewegung umschlossen: einen inneren Kreis und einen Ã¤uÃŸeren formierend, den Ã¤uÃŸeren als die UmwÃ¤lzung des Sichselbstgleichen, den inneren die des Andersseins oder Sichungleichen, jenen als den herrschenden, ungeteilten. Den inneren aber hat er wieder nach jenen VerhÃ¤ltnissen in sieben Kreise geteilt, wovon drei mit gleicher Geschwindigkeit, vier aber mit ungleicher Geschwindigkeit unter sich und gegen die drei ersten sich[97] umwÃ¤lzen. Dies ist nun das System der Seele, innerhalb der alles KÃ¶rperliche gebildet ist. Sie ist die Mitte, durchdringe das Ganze und umschlieÃŸt es ebenso von auÃŸen und bewegt sich in sich selbst â€“ und hat so den gÃ¶ttlichen Grund eines unaufhÃ¶rlichen und vernÃ¼nftigen Lebens in sich selbst.Â« 

> Dies ist nicht ganz ohne Verwirrung. Bei der Idee des kÃ¶rperlichen Universums kommt ihm schon die Seele als das umschlieÃŸende Einfache herein. Es ist nur das Allgemeine hieraus zu nehmen. Î±) Das Wesen des KÃ¶rperlichen und der Seele ist die Einheit in der Differenz. Î²) Dies Wesen ist ein Gedoppeltes es ist Î±Î±) selbst an und fÃ¼r sich selbst in der Differenz gesetzt, â€“ innerhalb des Einen systematisiert es sich in viele Momente, die aber Bewegungen sind, und Î²Î²) RealitÃ¤t; â€“ beide dieses Ganze in der Entgegensetzung von Seele und KÃ¶rperlichkeit, und dieses ist wieder Eins. Der Geist ist das Durchdringende, Mitte der Kugel, die Ausdehnung und das UmschlieÃŸende; das KÃ¶rperliche ist innerhalb seiner, â€“ d.h. es ist ihm ebensosehr entgegengesetzt, seine Differenz, wie es er selbst ist.

> Dies ist die allgemeine Bestimmung der Seele, die in die Welt gesetzt ist, diese regiert; und insofern ihr das Substantielle, was die Materie ist, Ã¤hnlich sieht, ist ihre IdentitÃ¤t in sich behauptet. Die Seele ist dasselbe Wesen wie das sichtbare Universum; es sind dieselben Momente, die ihre RealitÃ¤t ausmachen. (Gott als absolute Substanz sieht nichts anderes als sich selbst.) Platon beschreibt daher ihr VerhÃ¤ltnis zu dem gegenstÃ¤ndlichen Wesen so, daÃŸ sie, wenn sie eins der Momente desselben, entweder die teilbare oder unteilbare Substanz berÃ¼hre, sie sich in sich reflektierend darÃ¼ber bespreche, beides unterscheide, was dasselbe an ihm oder das Ungleiche sei, wie, wo und wann das Einzelne sich zueinander und zum Allgemeinen sich verhalte. Wenn der Kreis des Sinnlichen, richtig sich verlaufend, sich seiner ganzen Seele zu erkennen gibt, so entstehen wahre Meinungen und richtige Ãœberzeugungen (wenn die Â»verschiedenenÂ« Kreise des Weltlaufs sich Ã¼bereinstimmend zeigen mit dem Insichsein des Geistes). Â»Wenn die Seele aber sich an das VernÃ¼nftige wendet und der Kreis des Sichselbstgleichen sich zu erkennen gibt, so vollendet sich der Gedanke zur Wissenschaft.Â« 

> Dies ist nun die Idee, das Wesen der Welt, als des in sich seligen Gottes. Hier nach dieser Idee tritt erst die Welt hervor, hier ist erst die Idee des Ganzen vollendet. Es war bisher nur das Wesen des Sinnlichen, nicht die Welt als sinnliche noch hervorgetreten; ob er dort zwar schon von dem Feuer usf. gesprochen, so gibt er nur das Wesen. Platon scheint hier von vorne anzufangen, was er schon abgehandelt, aber dort nur das Wesen; jene AusdrÃ¼cke, Feuer usf., hÃ¤tte er besser weggelassen.
Weiter geht nun Platon fort. Diese gÃ¶ttliche Welt nennt er auch Â»das Muster, das allein im Gedanken (noÃªton) und immer in der Sichselbstgleichheit istÂ«. Er setzt dieses Ganze sich wieder so entgegen, daÃŸ Â»ein Zweites ist, das Abbild jenes Ersten, die Welt, die Entstehung hat und sichtbar istÂ« (48). Dies Zweite ist das System der himmlischen Bewegung, jenes Erste ist das ewige Leben. Â»Dasjenige, was Entstehung, Werden an ihm hat, ist nicht mÃ¶glich, ihmÂ« (der ersten Idee, jenem Ewigen) Â»vÃ¶llig gleichzumachen. Es ist aber ein sich bewegendes Bild des Ewigen, das in der Einheit bleibt, gemacht; und dies ewige Bild, das nach der Zahl sich bewegt (kat' arithmon iousan aiÃ´nion eikona), ist, was wir Zeit nen nen.Â« Platon sagt von ihr: Â»Wir pflegen das War und Wirdsein Teile der Zeit zu nennen und tragen in das absolute Wesen der Zeit diese Unterschiede der in der Zeit sich bewegenden VerÃ¤nderung (peri tÃªn en chronÃ´ genesin iousan). Die wahre Zeit aber ist ewig, oder sie ist die Gegenwart. Denn die Substanz ist weder Ã¤lter noch jÃ¼nger, und die Zeit, als unmittelbares Bild des Ewigen, hat ebenso nicht die Zukunft und Vergangenheit zu ihren Teilen.Â«  Die Zeit ist ideell, wie der Raum, â€“ die gegenstÃ¤ndliche Weise des Geistigen; es ist Raum, Zeit nichts Sinnliches, â€“ die unmittelbare Weise, wie der Geist in der gegenstÃ¤ndlichen Weise hervortritt, die sinnliche unsinnliche.


> Die realen Momente der Zeit â€“ des Prinzips der an und fÃ¼r sich seienden Bewegung im Zeitlichen â€“ sind nun die, an denen die VerÃ¤nderungen hervortreten: Â»Die Sonne, der Mond und die fÃ¼nf anderen Sterne, die Planeten, â€“ sie sind es, welche zur Bestimmung und Erhaltung (Bewahrung) der ZahlenverhÃ¤ltnisse der Zeit dienenÂ«, in ihnen sind die Zahlen der Zeit realisiert. So ist also die himmlische Bewegung (die wahre Zeit) das Bild des Ewigen, das in der Einheit bleibt oder worin das Ewige die Bestimmtheit des Sichselbstgleichen behÃ¤lt. Denn alles ist in der Zeit, d.h. eben in der negativen Einheit, welche nichts frei in sich einwurzeln und so dem Zufalle nach sich bewegen und bewegt werden lÃ¤ÃŸt.

> Aber dies Ewige ist auch in der Bestimmtheit der anderen Wesenheit, in der Idee des sich Ã¤ndernden und irrenden Prinzips, dessen Allgemeines die Materie ist. Die ewige Welt hat ein Abbild an der Welt, die der Zeit angehÃ¶rt; aber dieser gegenÃ¼ber ist eine zweite Welt, der die VerÃ¤nderlichkeit wesentlich innewohnt. Das Sichselbstgleiche und das Andere sind die abstraktesten GegensÃ¤tze, die wir frÃ¼her hatten. Die ewige Welt, als in die Zeit gesetzt, hat so zwei Formen, die Form des Sichselbstgleichen und die Form des Sich-Anderen, des Irrenden. Die drei Momente, wie sie in diesem Prinzip (SphÃ¤re) erscheinen, sind: u) das einfache Wesen, das erzeugt wird, Â»das EntstandeneÂ« (die bestimmte Materie); Î²) der Ort, Â»worin es erzeugt wird; und Î³) das, wovon das Gezeugte sein Urbild hatÂ«. Oder Platon gibt sie dann auch so an: Â»Das Wesen, der Ort und die ErzeugungÂ«, â€“ jenes Wesen die Nahrung, Substanz der Erzeugung. Wir haben den SchluÃŸ: Î±) das Wesen, das Allgemeine, Î²) den Ort (Raum), die Mitte, und Î³) die individuelle, einzelne Zeugung. Setzen wir dies Prinzip der Zeit nach ihrer NegativitÃ¤t entgegen, so ist das[100] einfache Moment des on â€“ dies Prinzip des Anderen, als allgemeines Prinzip â€“ ein Â»aufnehmendesÂ« Medium, ein Wesen Â»wie eine AmmeÂ«, welches alles erhÃ¤lt, fÃ¼r sich bestehen macht und fÃ¼r sich gewÃ¤hren lÃ¤ÃŸt. Dies Prinzip ist das Formlose, das aller Formen empfÃ¤nglich ist, das allgemeine Wesen alles unterschieden Erscheinenden. Es ist die schlechte passive Materie, das, was wir unter Materie verstehen, wenn wir davon sprechen. Die Materie ist hier das relativ Substantielle, das Bestehen Ã¼berhaupt, Ã¤uÃŸerliches Dasein, â€“ ist das abstrakte nur FÃ¼rsichsein. Wir unterscheiden davon in unserer Reflexion die Form; und nach Platon kommt erst durch die Amme die Form zum Bestehen. In dieses Prinzip fÃ¤llt das, was wir die Erscheinung nennen, denn die Materie ist eben dies Bestehen der einzelnen Zeugung, darin die Entzweiung gesetzt ist. Was nun aber hierin erscheint, ist nicht als Einzelnes irdischer Existenz zu setzen, selbst als Allgemeines in ihrer Bestimmtheit aufzufassen. Da die Materie, als das Allgemeine, das Wesen alles Einzelnen ist, so erinnert fÃ¼rs erste Platon, daÃŸ man von diesen sinnlichen Dingen nicht sprechen dÃ¼rfe: das Feuer, das Wasser, die Erde, die Luft usf. (hier ist wieder Feuer usf.); denn hierdurch werden sie als eine fixe Bestimmtheit ausgesagt, die als solche bleibt; was aber bleibt, ist nur ihre Allgemeinheit oder sie als Allgemeine, nur das Feurige, Irdische usf. 

> Ferner exponiert nun Platon die bestimmte Wesenheit dieser Dinge oder ihre einfache Bestimmtheit. In dieser Welt der VerÃ¤nderlichkeit ist nun die Form die rÃ¤umliche Figur. Wie in der Welt, welche unmittelbares Abbild des Ewigen ist, die Zeit das absolute Prinzip ist, so ist hier das absolute ideelle Prinzip oder die reine Materie als solche das Bestehen des Raums. Î±) Materie, Î²) Raum, Î³) Erzeugung: Der Raum ist das ideelle Wesen dieser erscheinenden Welt, die Mitte, welche die PositivitÃ¤t und NegativitÃ¤t vereint, und seine Bestimmtheiten sind die Figuren. Und zwar unter den Dimensionen des Raums ist es die FlÃ¤che,[101] welche als wahre Wesenheit genommen werden muÃŸ, da sie zwischen Linie und Punkt im Raume die Mitte fÃ¼r sich und in ihrer ersten realen Begrenzung Drei ist; so ist auch das Dreieck die erste der Figuren, wÃ¤hrend der Kreis die Grenze als solche nicht an ihm hat. Und hier kommt Platon auf die AusfÃ¼hrung der Figurationen; in diesen ist das Dreieck die Grundlage. Das Wesen der sinnlichen Dinge sind daher die Dreiecke. Und da sagt er denn auf pythagoreische Weise: Die Zusammensetzung und Verbindung dieser Dreiecke wieder nach den ursprÃ¼nglichen ZahlenverhÃ¤ltnissen macht dann die sinnlichen Elemente aus, â€“ jene Verbindung derselben ihre Idee (der Mitte angehÃ¶rend). Dies ist nun die Grundlage. Wie er nun die Figuren der Elemente und die Verbindungen der Dreiecke bestimme, Ã¼bergehe ich.

> Von hier geht Platon nun auch in eine Physik und Physiologie Ã¼ber, in die wir ihm nicht folgen wollen. Es ist als ein Anfang, kindlicher Versuch anzusehen, die sinnliche Erscheinung in ihrer Vielheit zu begreifen; aber er ist noch oberflÃ¤chlich und verworren, â€“ ein Aufnehmen der sinnlichen Erscheinung, z.B. der Teile und Glieder des KÃ¶rpers, und eine ErzÃ¤hlung desselben mit Gedanken vermischt, die sich unseren formellen ErklÃ¤rungen nÃ¤hern und worin in der Tat der Begriff ausgeht. Wir haben uns an die Erhabenheit der Idee zu halten, die das Vortreffliche ist; denn die Realisierung der Idee, â€“ davon hat Platon das BedÃ¼rfnis gefÃ¼hlt und ausgedrÃ¼ckt. Oft ist auch der spekulative Gedanke erkennbar, aber meistens geht die Betrachtung auf ganz Ã¤uÃŸerliche Weisen, z.B. ZweckmÃ¤ÃŸigkeit usf. Es ist andere Weise, die Physik zu behandeln, die empirische Kenntnis ist da auch noch mangelhaft; jetzt ist umgekehrt Mangel der Idee. Platon stellt, obschon er unserer den Begriff der Lebendigkeit nicht festhaltenden Physik nicht angemessen erscheint und nach kindlicher Weise in Ã¤uÃŸerlichen Analogien zu sprechen fortfÃ¤hrt, doch im einzelnen sehr tiefe, auch fÃ¼r uns wohl beachtenswerte Blicke dar, wenn anders die Betrachtung der Natur nach der Lebendigkeit Platz hÃ¤tte. Und ebenso beachtenswert wÃ¼rde uns seine Beziehung des Physiologischen auf Psychisches erscheinen. Einige Momente enthalten etwas Allgemeines, z.B. die Farben, von wo aus er in allgemeinere Betrachtungen wieder Ã¼bergeht. MerkwÃ¼rdig ist dies Ã¶ftere Anfangen von vorne; es liegt nicht darin, daÃŸ der Timaios ein Aggregat ist, sondern es ist die innerliche Notwendigkeit. Man muÃŸ vom Abstrakten anfangen, um zum Wahren, zum Konkreten zu kommen, und dies tritt erst spÃ¤ter ein; hat man dies nun, so hat es wieder den Schein und die Form eines Anfanges, besonders in der losen Weise Platons.

> Indem Platon auf die Farben zu reden kommt, so sagt er Ã¼ber die Schwierigkeit, das Einzelne zu unterscheiden und zu erkennen, daÃŸ bei der Naturbetrachtung zwei Ursachen zu unterscheiden sind: die notwendige und die gÃ¶ttliche. Â»In allem muÃŸ man das GÃ¶ttliche aufsuchen, um des seligen Lebens willenÂ« (eudaimonos biou, diese BeschÃ¤ftigung ist Zweck an und fÃ¼r sich, und darin liegt die GlÃ¼ckseligkeit), Â»soweit unsere Natur dessen empfÃ¤nglich ist; die notwendigen Ursachen nur zum Behuf jener Dinge, da wir sie ohne diese notwendigen UrsachenÂ« (Bedingungen der Erkenntnis) Â»nicht erkennen kÃ¶nnen.Â« Es ist die Ã¤uÃŸerliche Betrachtung der GegenstÃ¤nde, ihres Zusammenhangs, ihrer Beziehung usf. Â»Vom GÃ¶ttlichen ist Gott selbst der UrheberÂ«; das GÃ¶ttliche gehÃ¶rt jener ersten gÃ¶ttlichen Welt an, nicht als einer jenseitigen, sondern als einer gegenwÃ¤rtigen. Â»Die Erzeugung und Einrichtung der sterblichen Dinge hat Gott seinen Gehilfen aufgetragen (tois heautou gennÃªmasi dÃªmiourgein prosetaxen).Â« Dies ist eine leichte Manier des Ãœbergangs vom GÃ¶ttlichen zum Endlichen, Irdischen. Â»Diese nun, das GÃ¶ttliche nachahmend, weil sie in sich selbst das unsterbliche Prinzip einer Seele empfangen, so haben sie einen sterblichen KÃ¶rper gemacht und in diesen ein anderes sterbliches Bild (eidos) der Idee der Seele gesetzt (prosÃ´kodomounto). Dies sterbliche Bild enthÃ¤lt die gewalthabenden[103] und notwendigen Leidenschaften (deina kai anankaia pathÃªmata): das VergnÃ¼gen, Leid (Traurigkeit), Mut, Furcht, Zorn, Hoffnung usf. Diese Empfindungen alle gehÃ¶ren der sterblichen Seele an. Und um das GÃ¶ttliche nicht zu beflecken, wo es nicht unumgÃ¤nglich notwendig, so haben die unteren GÃ¶tter dieses Sterbliche vom Sitze des GÃ¶ttlichen getrennt und in einen anderen Teil des KÃ¶rpers eingewohnt und haben so einen Isthmus und Grenze gemacht zwischen Kopf und Brust, den Hals dazwischen setzend.Â« Die Empfindungen, Leidenschaften usf. wohnen nÃ¤mlich in der Brust, im Herzen (wir legen das Unsterbliche ins Herz); das Geistige ist im Kopfe. Aber um jenes so vollkommen zu machen wie mÃ¶glich, Â»haben sieÂ« z.B. Â»dem Herzen, von Zorn entbrannt, die Lunge als eine Hilfe beigesellt, weich und blutlos, dann durchbohrte RÃ¶hren wie in einem Schwamm habend, damit sie, Luft und GetrÃ¤nke (to pÃ´ma) in sich nehmend, das Herz abkÃ¼hle und eine Respiration und Erleichterung seiner Hitze gewÃ¤hre.Â« 

> Besonders merkwÃ¼rdig ist, was Platon dann Ã¼ber die Leber sagt: Â»Da der unvernÃ¼nftige Teil der Seele, der Begierde nach Essen und Trinken hat, die Vernunft nicht hÃ¶rt, hat Gott die Natur der Leber geschaffen, damit die aus dem nous herabsteigende Kraft der Gedanken in dieselbe, aufnehmend wie in einem Spiegel die Urbilder (typous) und ihnenÂ« (den unvernÃ¼nftigen Teilen) Â»Gespenster, Schreckbilder (eidÃ´la) zeigend, sie erschreckeÂ«; und zwar Â»damit, wenn dieser Teil der Seele besÃ¤nftigt ist, er im Schlafe der Gesichte teilhaftig werde (manteia chrÃ´menÃªn). Denn die uns gemacht haben, eingedenk des ewigen Gebots des Vaters, das sterbliche Geschlecht so gut zu machen als mÃ¶glich, haben den schlechteren Teil von uns so eingerichtet, daÃŸ er auch einigermaÃŸen der Wahrheit teilhaftig werde, und haben ihm die Weissagung (to manteion) gegeben.Â« Platon schreibt so die Weissagung der unvernÃ¼nftigen, leiblichen Seite des Menschen zu. Und obgleich man oft glaubt, daÃŸ bei Platon die Offenbarung usf. der Vernunft zugeschrieben werde, so ist dies doch falsch; es ist eine Vernunft, sagt er; aber in der UnvernÃ¼nftigkeit. Â»DaÃŸ Gott aber der menschlichen Unvernunft die Weissagung gegeben, davon ist dies ein hinreichender Beweis, daÃŸ kein seiner Vernunft mÃ¤chtiger Mensch (ennous) einer gÃ¶ttlichen (entheou) und wahrhaften Weissagung (alÃªthous mantikÃªs) teilhaftig wird; sondern nur, wenn entweder im Schlafe die Kraft der Besonnenheit (phronÃªseÃ´s) gefesselt ist oder wer durch Krankheit oder einen Enthusiasmus auÃŸer sich gebracht (verÃ¤ndert) ist (parallaxas).Â« Das Hellsehen erklÃ¤rt also Platon fÃ¼r das Niedrigere gegen das bewuÃŸte Wissen. Â»Der Besonnene (emphrÃ´n) aber hat solches (solche manteia) nun auszulegen und zu deuten; denn wer noch im Wahnsinn ist, kann es nicht beurteilen. Gut ist es schon von alters her gesagt worden: zu tun und zu erkennen das Seinige und sich selbst, kommt nur dem besonnenen Manne zu.Â« Man macht Platon zum Schutzpatron des bloÃŸen Enthusiasmus; das ist also ganz falsch. Dies sind die Hauptmomente der. Naturphilosophie Platons.

###### 3. Philosohy of spirit
 {#PlatoPhilosophyOfSpirit}

> Teils haben wir von diesem sein spekulatives Wesen (nicht die Bedeutung des Geistes, nicht realisiert, wie sie es heiÃŸen, am Geiste und an der Natur) schon gesehen, teils aber finden wir bei Platon noch kein ausgebildetes BewuÃŸtsein Ã¼ber den Organismus des theoretischen Geistes. Wir finden Empfindung, Erinnerung usf., Vernunft bei ihm unterschieden, aber diese Momente des Geistes weder genau bestimmt, noch in ihrem Zusammenhange exponiert, wie sie nach der Notwendigkeit sich zueinander verhalten. (Die Unterschiede in Ansehung des Erkennens sind zwar sehr wichtig, aber sie sind schon angefÃ¼hrt.) Sondern die reale, die praktische Seite des BewuÃŸtseins ist vorzÃ¼glich das GlÃ¤nzende bei Platon. Und was uns denn von dem, was auf die Seite des Geistes fÃ¤llt, interessieren kann, ist die Idee Platons Ã¼ber[105] die sittliche Natur des Menschen. (Dies hat denn auch nicht die Form, daÃŸ er sich um ein oberstes Moralprinzip bemÃ¼ht hÃ¤tte, wie es jetzt genannt wird und woran man etwas Leeres hat, indem man alles zu haben glaubt, â€“ noch um ein Naturrecht, diese triviale Abstraktion Ã¼ber das reale praktische Wesen, das Recht.) Diese sittliche Natur ist es, die er in seinen BÃ¼chern von der Republik expliziert. Die sittliche Natur des Menschen scheint uns entfernt zu sein vom Staate. Aber Platon erschien die RealitÃ¤t des Geistes â€“ des Geistes, insofern er der Natur entgegengesetzt ist â€“ in ihrer hÃ¶chsten Wahrheit, nÃ¤mlich als die Organisation eines Staats; und er erkannte, daÃŸ die sittliche Natur (der freie Wille in seiner VernÃ¼nftigkeit) nur zu ihrem Rechte, zu ihrer Wirklichkeit kommt in einem wahrhaften Volke.

> NÃ¤her ist nun zu bemerken, daÃŸ Platon in den BÃ¼chern von der Republik die Untersuchung seines Gegenstandes so einleitet, daÃŸ gezeigt werden solle, was die Gerechtigkeit sei. Nach mancherlei Hin- und Herreden und nach mehreren negativen Betrachtungen ihrer Definitionen sagt Platon endlich in seiner einfachen Weise: In Ansehung dieser Untersuchung verhalte es sich so, wie wenn jemandem aufgegeben worden wÃ¤re, kleine und entfernte Buchstabenschrift zu lesen, und die Bemerkung gemacht wÃ¼rde, daÃŸ dieselben Buchstaben sich in einem nÃ¤heren Orte und grÃ¶ÃŸer vorfinden, â€“ so wÃ¼rde er sie, wo sie grÃ¶ÃŸer sind, lieber erst lesen und dann auch die kleineren leichter lesen kÃ¶nnen. Ebenso wolle er nun mit der Gerechtigkeit verfahren. Die Gerechtigkeit sei nicht nur am Einzelnen, sondern auch am Staate, und der Staat grÃ¶ÃŸer als der Einzelne; sie werde deswegen auch an Staaten in grÃ¶ÃŸeren ZÃ¼gen ausgedrÃ¼ckt und leichter zu erkennen sein. (Das ist verschieden von stoischem Reden von dem Weisen.) Er wolle sie deswegen lieber, wie sie als Gerechtigkeit des Staats ist, betrachten (II, 368-369), â€“ eine naive, anmutige Einleitung. Platon fÃ¼hrt so durch Vergleichung die Frage nach der Gerechtigkeit herÃ¼ber zur Betrachtung des Staats. Das ist ein sehr[106] naiver Ãœbergang, er scheint willkÃ¼rlich; der groÃŸe Sinn fÃ¼hrte die Alten aber zum Wahren. Was Platon bloÃŸ fÃ¼r eine grÃ¶ÃŸere Leichtigkeit ausgibt, ist in der Tat vielmehr die Natur der Sache. Denn die Gerechtigkeit in ihrer RealitÃ¤t und Wahrheit ist allein im Staate. Das Recht ist Dasein der Freiheit, Wirklichkeit des SelbstbewuÃŸten, die reale Seite und Weise des Geistes. Der Staat ist objektive Wirklichkeit des Rechts. Das Recht ist das geistige Insich- und Beisichsein, das Dasein haben will, tÃ¤tig ist, â€“ Freiheit, die sich Dasein gibt; die Sache ist mein, d.h. ich setze meine Freiheit in diese Ã¤uÃŸerliche Sache. Der Geist ist einerseits erkennend, nach der andern Seite will er, d.h. er will sich RealitÃ¤t geben. Die RealitÃ¤t, worin der ganze Geist ist, nicht das Mich-Wissen als diesen Einzelnen, ist der Staat. Denn wie der freie vernÃ¼nftige Wille sich bestimmt, sind es Gesetze der Freiheit; aber diese Gesetze sind eben als Gesetze der Staaten, da es eben der Staat ist, daÃŸ der vernÃ¼nftige Wille existiere, wirklich vorhanden sei. Im Staate also gelten die Gesetze, sind seine Gewohnheit und seine Sitte; weil aber die WillkÃ¼r ebenso unmittelbar dabei ist, so sind sie nicht bloÃŸ Sitte, sondern mÃ¼ssen zugleich auch Macht sein gegen die WillkÃ¼r, wie sie in den Gerichten und Regierungen erscheint. Das ist das Wesen des Staats; und mit diesem Instinkt der Vernunft hÃ¤lt er sich an diese ZÃ¼ge, wie der Staat diese ZÃ¼ge der Gerechtigkeit darstellt.
Das Gerechte an sich stellt sich uns gemeiniglich in der Form vor. Wenn von einem natÃ¼rlichen Recht, vom Recht in einem Naturzustande gesprochen wird, so ist ein solcher Naturzustand unmittelbar ein sittliches Unding. Was an sich ist, wird von denen, die das Allgemeine nicht erreichen, fÃ¼r etwas NatÃ¼rliches gehalten, wie die notwendigen Momente des Geistes fÃ¼r angeborene Ideen. Das NatÃ¼rliche ist vielmehr das vom Geist Aufzuhebende, und der Naturzustand kann nur so auftreten, sein Recht ist nur dieses, daÃŸ er das absolute Unrecht des Geistes ist. Der Staat ist der reale Geist. Der Geist in seinem einfachen, noch nicht[107] realisierten Begriff ist das abstrakte Ansich, und dieser Begriff, das Ansich, muÃŸ allerdings vorhergehender Konstruktion seiner RealitÃ¤t; und dies ist es, was als Naturzustand aufgefaÃŸt worden ist. Wir sind es gewohnt, von der Fiktion eines Naturzustandes auszugehen, der freilich kein Zustand des Geistes, des vernÃ¼nftigen Willens, sondern der Tiere untereinander ist. Der Krieg aller gegen alle ist der wahre Naturzustand, wie Hobbes sehr richtig bemerkt hat. Dieses Ansich oder der nicht reale Begriff des Geistes ist zugleich der einzelne Mensch; er existiert als solcher. Alsdann trennt sich in der Vorstellung Ã¼berhaupt das Allgemeine von dem Einzelnen, als ob der Einzelne an und fÃ¼r sich wÃ¤re, so wie er einmal ist, als ob das Allgemeine ihn nicht zu dem machte, was er in Wahrheit ist, es nicht sein Wesen wÃ¤re, sondern das das Wichtigste wÃ¤re, was er Besonderes an sich hat. Die Fiktion des Naturstandes fÃ¤ngt von der Einzelheit der Person an und deren freiem Willen und der Beziehung auf andere Personen nach diesem freien Willen. Was von Natur Recht sei, hat man das genannt, was am Einzelnen und fÃ¼r den Einzelnen Recht ist; und den Zustand der Gesellschaft und des Staats hat man bloÃŸ gelten lassen als Mittel fÃ¼r die einzelne Person, die der Grundzweck ist. Platon umgekehrt legt das Substantielle, Allgemeine zugrunde, und zwar so, daÃŸ der Einzelne als solcher eben dies Allgemeine zu seinem Zweck, seiner Sitte, seinem Geiste habe, daÃŸ der Einzelne fÃ¼r den Staat wolle, handle, lebe und genieÃŸe, so daÃŸ er seine zweite Natur, seine Gewohnheit und seine Sitte sei. Diese sittliche Substanz, die den Geist, das Leben und das Wesen der IndividualitÃ¤t ausmacht und die Grundlage ist, systematisiert sich in einem lebendigen organischen Ganzen, indem es sich wesentlich in seine Glieder unterscheidet, deren TÃ¤tigkeit eben das Hervorbringen des Ganzen ist. Dies VerhÃ¤ltnis des Begriffs zu seiner RealitÃ¤t ist bei Platon freilich nicht zum BewuÃŸtsein gekommen. Wir finden bei ihm keine philosophische Konstruktion, welche zuerst die Idee an und fÃ¼r sich, alsdann in[108] ihr selbst die Notwendigkeit ihrer Realisation und diese selbst aufzeigt.
Platon hat also in seiner Republik ein sogenanntes Ideal von einer Staatsverfassung gegeben, die als sobriquet sprichwÃ¶rtlich geworden ist in dem Sinne, daÃŸ es eine ChimÃ¤re sei. Oder Ã¼ber die Platonische Republik hat sich dieses Urteil fixiert, daÃŸ sie, wie sie Platon beschreibt, allerdings vortrefflich wÃ¤re â€“ in dem Sinne, daÃŸ sie wohl gedacht werden kÃ¶nne im Kopfe, an sich im Gedanken diese Vorstellung wahr sei; daÃŸ sie auch ausfÃ¼hrbar sei, aber unter der Bedingung nur, daÃŸ die Menschen vortrefflich sind, â€“ wie vielleicht im Monde; daÃŸ sie aber nicht ausfÃ¼hrbar sei fÃ¼r die Menschen, wie sie einmal auf Erden sind (man mÃ¼sse die Menschen nehmen, wie sie sind, das Ideal kann man wegen der Schlechtigkeit der Menschen nicht ins Dasein bringen), und daÃŸ daher so ein Ideal doch sehr mÃ¼ÃŸig sei.
Î±) FÃ¼rs erste ist hierÃ¼ber zu bemerken, daÃŸ in der christlichen Welt Ã¼berhaupt ein Ideal eines vollkommenen Menschen gang und gÃ¤be ist, das freilich nicht wohl in Menge wie der Menge eines Volkes vorhanden sein kann. Wenn wir es in MÃ¶nchen oder in QuÃ¤kern oder dergleichen frommen Leuten realisiert finden, so kÃ¶nnte ein Haufen solcher tristen GeschÃ¶pfe kein Volk ausmachen, sowenig als LÃ¤use (Parasitenpflanzen) fÃ¼r sich existieren kÃ¶nnten, nur auf einem organischen KÃ¶rper. Wenn sie ein solches konstituieren sollten, so mÃ¼ÃŸte diese lammsmÃ¤ÃŸige Sanftmut, diese Eitelkeit, die sich nur mit der eigenen Person beschÃ¤ftigt und diese hegt und pflegt, sich immer das Bild und BewuÃŸtsein der eigenen Vortrefflichkeit gibt, zugrunde gehen. Denn das Leben im und fÃ¼rs Allgemeine fordert nicht jene lahme und feige, sondern eine ebenso energische Sanftmut, â€“ nicht eine BeschÃ¤ftigung mit sich und seinen SÃ¼nden, sondern mit dem Allgemeinen und dem, was fÃ¼r dieses zu tun ist. Wem nun jenes schlechte Ideal vorschwebt, der findet freilich die Menschen immer mit SchwÃ¤che und Verderbnis behaftet und findet jenes Ideal nicht realisiert. Denn sie machen eben aus[109] Lumpereien eine Wichtigkeit, worauf kein VernÃ¼nftiger sieht, und meinen, solche Schwachheiten und Fehler seien doch vorhanden, wenn sie sie auch Ã¼bersehen. Allein es ist nicht ihre GroÃŸmut zu schÃ¤tzen; sondern vielmehr, daÃŸ sie auf das, was sie Schwachheit und Fehler nennen, sehen, ist ihr eigenes Verderben, das etwas daraus macht. Der Mensch, der sie hat, ist unmittelbar durch sich selbst davon absolviert, insofern er nichts daraus macht. Das Laster ist nur dieses, wenn sie ihm wesentlich sind, und das Verderben dieses, sie fÃ¼r etwas Wesentliches zu halten.
Die Wahrheit ist keine ChimÃ¤re. WÃ¼nsche zu machen, ist freilich ganz erlaubt. Wenn man aber Ã¼ber GroÃŸes und Wahrhaftes in sich nur frommes WÃ¼nschen hat, so ist das gottlos; ebenso wenn man nichts tun kann, weil alles heilig und unverletzlich sei, und nichts Bestimmtes sein will, weil alles Bestimmte seinen Mangel habe. Jenes Ideal muÃŸ uns also nicht im Wege stehen, in welcher feinen Form es sei: nicht gerade MÃ¶nche und QuÃ¤ker, aber doch dies Prinzip der sinnlichen Entbehrung und der Energie des Tuns, das vieles zu Boden schlagen muÃŸ, was sonst gilt. Alle VerhÃ¤ltnisse erhalten, ist widersprechend; es ist immer eine Seite, wo sie beleidigt werden, die sonst gelten. Was ich schon Ã¼ber das VerhÃ¤ltnis der Philosophie zum Staate angefÃ¼hrt habe, zeigt, daÃŸ dies Ideal nicht in diesem Sinne zu nehmen ist. Wenn ein Ideal Ã¼berhaupt in sich Wahrheit hat durch die Idee, durch den Begriff, so ist es keine ChimÃ¤re, ist wahrhaft; und ein solches Ideal ist nichts MÃ¼ÃŸiges, nichts Kraftloses, sondern ist das Wirkliche. Das wahrhafte Ideal soll nicht wirklich sein, sondern ist wirklich und allein das Wirkliche; â€“ dies glaubt man zunÃ¤chst. Soll eine Idee zur Existenz zu gut sein, so ist dies Fehler des Ideals selbst. Die Platonische Republik wÃ¤re deswegen eine ChimÃ¤re, nicht weil solche Vortrefflichkeit der Menschheit fehlt, sondern sie, diese Vortrefflichkeit, zu schlecht fÃ¼r sie wÃ¤re. Die Wirklichkeit ist zu gut; was wirklich ist, ist vernÃ¼nftig. Man muÃŸ aber wissen, unterscheiden, was in der Tat wirklich[110] ist; im gemeinen Leben ist alles wirklich, aber es ist ein Unterschied zwischen Erscheinungswelt und Wirklichkeit. Das Wirkliche hat auch Ã¤uÃŸerliches Dasein; das bietet WillkÃ¼r, ZufÃ¤lligkeit dar, wie in der Natur Baum, Haus, Pflanze zusammenkommen. Die OberflÃ¤che im Sittlichen, das Handeln der Menschen hat viel Schlimmes; da kÃ¶nnte vieles besser sein. Erkennt man die Substanz, so muÃŸ man durch die OberflÃ¤che hindurchsehen. Menschen werden immer lasterhaft, verderbt sein; das ist nicht die Idee. An der OberflÃ¤che balgen sich die Leidenschaften herum; das ist nicht die Wirklichkeit der Substanz. Das Zeitliche, VergÃ¤ngliche existiert wohl, kann einem wohl Not genug machen, aber dessenungeachtet ist es keine wahrhafte Wirklichkeit, wie auch nicht die PartikularitÃ¤t des Subjekts, seine WÃ¼nsche, Neigungen.

> Mit Beziehung auf diese Bemerkung ist an den Unterschied zu denken, der vorhin bei der Platonischen Naturphilosophie gemacht ist: Die ewige Welt, als der in sich selige Gott, ist die Wirklichkeit, nicht drÃ¼ben, nicht jenseits, sondern die gegenwÃ¤rtige wirkliche Welt in ihrer Wahrheit betrachtet, nicht wie sie dem GehÃ¶r, Gesicht usf. in die Sinne fÃ¤llt. Wenn wir so den Inhalt der Platonischen Idee betrachten, so wird sich ergeben, daÃŸ Platon in der Tat die griechische Sittlichkeit nach ihrer substantiellen Weise dargestellt hat. Das griechische Staatsleben ist das, was den wahrhaften Inhalt der Platonischen Republik ausmacht. Platon ist nicht der Mensch, der sich mit abstrakten Theorien und GrundsÃ¤tzen herumtreibt, sein wahrhafter Geist hat Wahrhaftes erkannt und dargestellt; und dies konnte nichts anderes sein als das Wahrhafte der Welt, worin er lebte, dieses einen Geistes, der in ihm so gut lebendig gewesen ist wie in Griechenland. Es kann niemand seine Zeit Ã¼berspringen, der Geist seiner Zeit ist auch sein Geist; aber es handelt sich darum, ihn nach seinem Inhalte zu erkennen.

> Î²) Auf der andern Seite ist eine vollkommene Konstitution in Beziehung auf ein Volk so zu betrachten, daÃŸ die Konstitution[111] nicht fÃ¼r jedes Volk taugt. In dieser RÃ¼cksicht ist wesentlich â€“ wenn gesagt wird, daÃŸ eine wahrhafte Konstitution nicht fÃ¼r die Menschen, wie sie nun sind, passe â€“
Î±Î±) dies zu bedenken, daÃŸ eben die Konstitution eines Volkes, je vortrefflicher sie ist, das Volk eben um so vortrefflicher macht, aber Î²Î²) umgekehrt (da die Sitten die lebendige Konstitution sind) die Konstitution ebenso in ihrer Abstraktion nichts fÃ¼r sich ist, sondern sich auf sie beziehen muÃŸ, und der lebendige Geist dieses Volkes sie erfÃ¼llen muÃŸ. Es kann darum gar nicht gesagt werden, daÃŸ eine wahrhafte Konstitution fÃ¼r jedes Volk passe; und es ist allerdings der Fall, daÃŸ fÃ¼r die Menschen, wie sie sind, z.B. wie sie Irokesen, Russen, Franzosen sind, nicht jede tauglich ist. Denn das Volk fÃ¤llt in die Geschichte. Aber wie der einzelne Mensch im Staate erzogen, d.h. er als Einzelheit in die Allgemeinheit erhoben wird und aus dem Kinde erst ein Mensch wird, so wird auch jedes Volk erzogen; sein Zustand, worin es Kind ist, oder die Barbarei geht in einen vernÃ¼nftigen Zustand Ã¼ber. Und die Menschen bleiben nicht nur, wie sie sind, sondern sie werden anders; ebenso ihre Konstitutionen. Und es ist hier die Frage, welches die wahrhafte ist, der das Volk zugehen muÃŸ, â€“ wie die Frage ist, welches die wahre Wissenschaft der Mathematik oder jede andere ist; aber nicht, als ob Kinder oder Knaben jetzt diese Wissenschaft besitzen sollten, sondern daÃŸ sie so erzogen werden, daÃŸ sie dieser Wissenschaft fÃ¤hig werden. So steht dem geschichtlichen Volke die wahre Konstitution bevor, so daÃŸ es ihr zugeht. Jedes Volk muÃŸ mit dem Fortgange der Zeit solche VerÃ¤nderungen mit seiner vorhandenen Konstitution machen, welche sie der wahren immer nÃ¤her bringen. Sein Geist tritt selbst seine Kinderschuhe aus; und die Konstitution ist das BewuÃŸtsein Ã¼ber das, was er an sich ist, â€“ die Form der Wahrheit, des Wissens von sich. Ist ihm das Ansich nicht mehr wahr, was ihm seine Konstitution noch als das Wahre ausspricht, sein BewuÃŸtsein oder Begriff und seine RealitÃ¤t verschieden, so ist der Volksgeist ein zerrissenes,[112] geteiltes Wesen. Es treten zwei FÃ¤lle ein. Das Volk zerschlÃ¤gt durch einen inneren gewaltsameren Ausbruch dies Recht, das noch gelten soll, oder Ã¤ndert auch ruhiger und langsamer dasjenige, was noch als Recht gilt, das Gesetz, das nicht mehr wahre Sitte ist, worÃ¼ber der Geist hinaus ist. Oder es hat den Verstand und die Kraft nicht dazu, sondern bleibt bei dem niedrigeren Gesetze stehen; oder ein anderes Volk hat seine hÃ¶here Konstitution erreicht, es ist hierdurch ein vortrefflicheres Volk, â€“ und jenes erste hÃ¶rt gegen es auf; ein Volk zu sein, und muÃŸ ihm unterliegen.

> Deswegen ist es wesentlich, zu wissen, was die wahre Konstitution ist; denn was ihr widerstreitet, hat keinen Bestand, keine Wahrheit, es hebt sich auf. Es hat ein zeitliches Dasein und kann sich nicht erhalten: es hat gegolten, aber kann nicht fortwÃ¤hrend gelten; daÃŸ es abgeschafft werden muÃŸ, liegt in der Idee der Konstitution. Diese Einsicht kann allein durch die Philosophie erreicht werden. StaatsumwÃ¤lzungen geschehen ohne gewaltsame Revolutionen, wenn die Einsicht allgemein ist; Einrichtungen fallen ab, verlieren sich, man weiÃŸ nicht wie, â€“ jeder ergibt sich drein, sein Recht zu verlieren. DaÃŸ es aber an der Zeit damit ist, muÃŸ die Regierung wissen. KnÃ¼pft aber die Regierung, unwissend Ã¼ber das, was die Wahrheit ist, sich an zeitliche Einrichtungen, nimmt sie das unwesentlich Geltende in Schutz gegen das Wesentliche â€“ und was dieses ist, ist in der Idee enthalten -so wird sie selbst damit von dem drÃ¤ngenden Geiste gestÃ¼rzt, und die AuflÃ¶sung der Regierung lÃ¶st das Volk selbst auf; es entsteht neue Regierung, â€“ oder die Regierung und das Unwesentliche behÃ¤lt die Oberhand.

> Der Hauptgedanke, der nun Platons Republik zugrunde liegt, ist der, der als Prinzip der griechischen Sittlichkeit anzusehen ist, daÃŸ nÃ¤mlich das Sittliche das VerhÃ¤ltnis des Substantiellen habe, als gÃ¶ttlich festgehalten werde, â€“ so daÃŸ jedes einzelne Subjekt den Geist, das Allgemeine zu seinem Zwecke, zu seinem Geiste und Sitte habe, nur aus,[113] in diesem Geiste wolle, handle, lebe und genieÃŸe, â€“ so daÃŸ dies seine Natur, d. i. seine zweite geistige Natur sei, das Subjektive es in der Weise einer Natur als Sitte und Gewohnheit des Substantiellen habe. Dies ist nun allerdings die Grundbestimmung, das Substantielle Ã¼berhaupt. Die Bestimmung, die diesem entgegensteht â€“ diesem substantiellen VerhÃ¤ltnis der Individuen zur Sitte â€“, ist die subjektive WillkÃ¼r der Individuen, die Moral; daÃŸ die Individuen nicht aus Achtung, Ehrfurcht fÃ¼r die Institutionen des Staats, des Vaterlandes aus sich heraus handeln, sondern aus eigener Ãœberzeugung, nach einer moralischen Ãœberlegung einen EntschluÃŸ aus sich fassen, sich danach bestimmen. Dies Prinzip der subjektiven Freiheit ist ein spÃ¤teres, ist das Prinzip der modernen, ausgebildeten Zeit. Dies Prinzip ist in die griechische Welt auch gekommen, aber als Prinzip des Verderbens der griechischen Staaten, des griechischen Lebens. Es war das Verderben, weil der griechische Geist, Staatsverfassung, Gesetze nicht berechnet waren und darauf nicht berechnet sein konnten, daÃŸ innerhalb ihrer dies Prinzip auftreten wÃ¼rde. Beides ist nicht homogen; und so muÃŸten griechische Sitte und Gewohnheit untergehen. Platon hat nun den Geist, das Wahrhafte seiner Welt erkannt und aufgefaÃŸt und hat es ausgefÃ¼hrt nach der nÃ¤heren Bestimmung, daÃŸ er dies neue Prinzip verbannen, unmÃ¶glich machen wollte in seiner Republik. Es ist so ein substantieller Standpunkt, auf dem er steht, indem das Substantielle seiner Zeit zugrunde liegt; aber er ist auch nur relativ so, da es nur ein griechischer Standpunkt ist und das spÃ¤tere Prinzip mit BewuÃŸtsein ausgeschlossen wird. Dies ist das Allgemeine des Platonischen Ideals vom Staate; und aus diesem Gesichtspunkte muÃŸ man es betrachten. Untersuchungen, ob ein solcher Staat mÃ¶glich und der beste ist, die sich auf die neuesten Gesichtspunkte basieren, fÃ¼hren nur auf schiefe Ansichten. In modernen Staaten ist Freiheit des Gewissens; jedes Individuum kann fordern, fÃ¼r seine Interessen sich ergehen zu kÃ¶nnen; dies ist aber aus der Platonischen Idee ausgeschlossen.

> Erstens. Ich will nun in nÃ¤herer AusfÃ¼hrung die Hauptmomente angeben, insofern sie philosophisches Interesse haben. Was nun das Wesen des Staats und was der Staat in seiner Wahrheit ist, stellt Platon dar. Er hat eine Schranke, die wir kennenlernen werden: daÃŸ der Einzelne nicht im formalen Recht dieser Allgemeinheit entgegensteht wie in der toten Konstitution der Rechtsstaaten. Der Inhalt ist nur das Ganze, die Natur des Individuums, â€“ aber sich reflektierend ins Allgemeine, nicht fixiert, an und fÃ¼r sich geltend. Es ist schon bemerkt, daÃŸ ausgegangen wird von der Gerechtigkeit, daÃŸ Platon sagt, es sei bequem, die Gerechtigkeit im Staate zu betrachten. Es ist aber nicht die Bequemlichkeit, die ihn dahin fÃ¼hrt; sondern es ist dies, daÃŸ die AusfÃ¼hrung der Gerechtigkeit nur mÃ¶glich ist, insofern der Mensch Mitglied des Staates ist, der als solcher wesentlich sittlich ist. Die Gerechtigkeit schlieÃŸt allein in sich, daÃŸ der Gerechte nur als sittliches Mitglied des Staats existiere. Die Gerechtigkeit ist nun nach Platon, daÃŸ der substantielle Geist Wirklichkeit habe und wie diese Wirklichkeit beschaffen sei. Platon zeigt das praktische Wesen am Staate zuerst auf, und dann, daÃŸ es dasselbe am Einzelnen ist. Die Idee ist konkret, ebenso das Sittliche. In der nÃ¤heren Weise der Behandlung legt er nun den Organismus des sittlichen Gemeinwesens, d.h. die Unterschiede, die in der sittlichen Substanz liegen, auseinander; sie ist so lebendig, daseiend. Er entfaltet die Momente, die im Begriffe liegen; sie sind nicht unabhÃ¤ngig, sondern nur gehalten in der Einheit. Platon betrachtet diese Momente des sittlichen Organismus in drei Gestalten: Î±) wie sie im Staate als StÃ¤nde sind, Î²) als Tugenden, Momente des Sittlichen, Î³) wie sie Momente des einzelnen Subjekts, der empirischen Wirksamkeit des Willens sind. Platon predigt nicht Moral, er zeigt, wie das Sittliche sich lebendig in sich bewegt; seine Funktionen, Eingeweide stellt er auf. Innere Systematisierung wie im organischen Leibe, nicht gediegene, tote Einheit wie die MetallitÃ¤t, sondern in sich lebendige, sich bewegende, kommt[115] eben durch die Unterschiede (Funktionen der Eingeweide) hervor, welche sie machen.
a) Ohne StÃ¤nde, ohne diese Teilung in groÃŸe Massen, hat der Staat keinen Organismus; diese groÃŸen Unterschiede sind der Unterschied des Substantiellen. Der Gegensatz des Allgemeinen, als StaatsgeschÃ¤fts und Lebens im Staate, und des Einzelnen, als Lebens und Arbeitens fÃ¼r das Einzelne, kommt gleichfalls vor. Beide GeschÃ¤fte sind so verteilt, daÃŸ die eine Klasse, ein Stand, jenem gewidmet ist, ein anderer aber diesem. Platon fÃ¼hrt nun drei Systeme der Wirklichkeit des Sittlichen auf: Die Funktionen Î±) der Gesetzgebung, Beratung, Ã¼berhaupt der TÃ¤tigkeit, Vorsorge fÃ¼r das Allgemeine, die Interessen des Ganzen als solchen, Î²) der Verteidigung des Gemeinwesens nach auÃŸen gegen Feinde, Î³) der Sorge fÃ¼r das Einzelne, das BedÃ¼rfnis: Ackerbau, Viehzucht, Verfertigung der Bekleidung, HÃ¤user, GerÃ¤te usf. Dies ist im allgemeinen ganz richtig, doch erscheint es mehr als Ã¤uÃŸere Notwendigkeit, weil sich solche BedÃ¼rfnisse vorfinden; es ist nicht aus der Idee des Geistes selbst entwickelt. Ferner werden diese unterschiedenen Funktionen nun an verschiedene Systeme verteilt, â€“ einer Masse von Individuen zugeteilt, die dazu besonders bestimmt sind. Und das gibt die unterschiedenen StÃ¤nde des Staats, indem Platon ebenfalls gegen die oberflÃ¤chliche Vorstellung ist, daÃŸ einer und derselbe alles zusammen sein mÃ¼sse. Er fÃ¼hrt nun drei StÃ¤nde auf: Î±) den der Regierer, Gelehrten, Wissenden; Î²) den der Krieger; Î³) den des Anschaffens der BedÃ¼rfnisse: Ackerbauer und Handwerker. Den ersten nennt er auch den der WÃ¤chter, wesentlich philosophisch gebildete StaatsmÃ¤nner, die die wahrhafte Wissenschaft besitzen. (II, 369-376) Diese Abteilung der StÃ¤nde deduziert Platon nicht, diese Unterschiede sind aber notwendig; jeder Staat ist notwendig ein System dieser Systeme innerhalb seiner selbst. Auf diese Weise bildet die Einteilung in StÃ¤nde die Konstitution des Platonischen Staates. Platon geht dann hierbei zu einzelnen Bestimmungen Ã¼ber, die zum Teil kleinlich sind und besser[116] entbehrt wÃ¼rden; z.B. er bestimmt sogar fÃ¼r den ersten Stand besondere Titulaturen (V, 463), spricht von der Erziehung, wie die Ammen sich benehmen sollen (V, 460) usf.

> b) Alsdann zeigt Platon die Momente, welche hier in StÃ¤nde realisiert sind, als dasjenige, was wir Eigenschaften nennen, die in den Individuen vorhanden sind, als sittliche Wesenheiten auf, â€“ der einfache sittliche Begriff in seine Bestimmtheiten verteilt, die allgemein. Indem Platon die StÃ¤nde auf diese Weise unterscheidet, gibt er als Resultat an, daÃŸ durch solch einen Organismus alle Tugenden im Gemeinwesen lebendig vorhanden seien. Diese Tugenden, die er nun angibt, sind vier, und man hat sie Kardinaltugenden genannt.
Î±) Als erste Tugend erscheint die Weisheit und die Wissenschaft. Â»Ein solcher Staat wird weise und wohlberaten sein, und zwar so sein nicht wegen der mannigfaltigen Wissenschaften (Kenntnisse), die darin vorhanden sind, welche sich auf die einzelnen BeschÃ¤ftigungen beziehen, aufs Viele, was gemein ist, und ein Eigentum der Menge sind (Handwerkswissenschaften), wie Schmiedekunst, Ackerbau (Kameral-Wissenschaften), sondern wegen der wahrhaften Wissenschaft, der Wissenschaft der Vorsteher und Regenten, welche das Ganze berÃ¤t, das Allgemeine weiÃŸ, sowohl wiefern es sich in sich selbst und zu anderen Staaten aufs Beste verhÃ¤lt, und die eigentlich nur der Besitz des kleinsten Teils ist. Diese Einsicht hat ihre RealitÃ¤t an dem Stande der Beratenden (Regenten).Â« (IV, 427-429)

> Î²) Die zweite Tugend ist die Tapferkeit, welche Platon so bestimmt, daÃŸ sie Â»eine feste Behauptung der gerechten und den Gesetzen gemÃ¤ÃŸen Meinung ist, von dem, was mÃ¤chtig, wichtig, zu fÃ¼rchten ist (deinÃ´n), und die, im GemÃ¼te befestigt, sich durch Begierden, durch VergnÃ¼gen nicht wankend machen lÃ¤ÃŸt. Dieser Tugend entspricht der Stand der Tapferen.Â« (IV, 429-430)

> Î³) Die dritte Tugend ist die MÃ¤ÃŸigung (sÃ´phrosynÃª), Â»die Gewalt Ã¼ber die Begierden und Leidenschaften, die wie eine Harmonie durch das Ganze verbreitet ist; so daÃŸ die schwÃ¤cheren[117] Menschen und die stÃ¤rkeren, es sei nach dem Verstande betrachtet, nach der StÃ¤rke oder Menge oder Reichtum, oder in welcher RÃ¼cksicht es sei, auf ein und dasselbe zusammenwirken und miteinander Ã¼bereinstimmen. Diese Tugend ist nicht, wie Weisheit und Tapferkeit, auf Teile (StÃ¤nde) eingeschrÃ¤nkt, sondern den Regenten und Regierten gemeinschaftlich, als eine Harmonie verteilt, die Tugend aller Â« (IV, 430-432) Diese MÃ¤ÃŸigung ist eigentlich die Tugend des dritten Standes. Die Harmonie, in der alles zu einem Zwecke wirkt, scheint bei dem ersten Anblicke dem dritten Stande (Herbeischaffung der BedÃ¼rfnisse und Arbeit) nicht sogleich zu entsprechen. Allein die sÃ´phrosynÃª ist eben dieses, daÃŸ kein Moment, keine Bestimmtheit, Einzelheit sich isoliert (im Moralischen, daÃŸ kein BedÃ¼rfnis sich zum Wesen macht, Laster wird). Die Arbeit ist gerade dies Moment der aufs Einzelne sich beschrÃ¤nkenden TÃ¤tigkeit, die aber ins Allgemeine zurÃ¼ckgeht, fÃ¼r es ist. Diese Tugend ist allgemein; aber sie findet besonders statt in Ansehung des dritten Standes, der zunÃ¤chst nur in Harmonie zu bringen ist, indem er nicht die absolute Harmonie hat, die die anderen StÃ¤nde in sich selbst haben.

> Î´) Die vierte Tugend endlich ist die Gerechtigkeit, um die es von Anfang zu tun gewesen. Diese wird im Staate (als Rechtschaffenheit) Â»darin gefunden, daÃŸ jeder Einzelne sich nur um eine Sache, die sich auf den Staat bezieht, bemÃ¼he (epitÃªdeuein), wozu seine Natur am geschicktesten geboren ist, â€“ so daÃŸ jeder nicht vielerlei treibt, sondern das ihm Zukommende: Jung und Alt, Knaben, Weiber, Freie, Sklaven, Handwerker, Obrigkeiten und RegierteÂ«. Es ist hierÃ¼ber zu bemerken: Platon stellt die Gerechtigkeit hier neben die anderen Momente; sie erscheint so als das Vierte, als eine der vier Bestimmungen. Aber er nimmt dies so zurÃ¼ck, daÃŸ sie es nun sei, Â»welche dem anderen â€“ MÃ¤ÃŸigkeit, Tapferkeit, Weisheit â€“, was zu den Staatseinrichtungen gehÃ¶rt, und denselben, unter diese allgemeinen Gesichtspunkte zusammengefaÃŸt, die Kraft (dynamin) gibt, daÃŸ sie werden und[118] daÃŸ sie, wenn sie vorhanden sind, ihre Wirkung, das Ganze zu erhalten, hervorbringen (hÃ´ste engenesthai kai engenomena ge sÃ´tÃªrian parechein).Â« Deswegen er auch gesagt hatte, die Gerechtigkeit werde fÃ¼r sich selbst schon vorhanden angetroffen werden, wenn jene anderen Tugenden gefunden sind (esesthai to hypoleiphthen ekeinÃ´n, ei ta tria heuroimen). (IV, 432-433) Bestimmter dies gesagt, so ist der Begriff der Gerechtigkeit die Grundlage, die Idee des Ganzen, welches so in sich organisch geteilt ist, daÃŸ jeder Teil nur als Moment im Ganzen ist und das Ganze durch ihn ist, so daÃŸ an diesem jene StÃ¤nde oder Eigenschaften nur eben diese Momente sind. Die Gerechtigkeit nur ist dies Allgemeine, Durchdringende, â€“ das FÃ¼rsichsein jedes Teils, den der Staat fÃ¼r sich gewÃ¤hren lÃ¤ÃŸt. Es erhellt hieraus, daÃŸ Platon unter Gerechtigkeit nicht das Recht des Eigentums, wie gemeinhin in der Rechtswissenschaft, verstanden hat, sondern daÃŸ der Geist in seiner TotalitÃ¤t zu seinem Rechte, Dasein gelange. Im Eigentum ist hÃ¶chst abstrakt meine PersÃ¶nlichkeit, meine ganz abstrakte Freiheit vorhanden. Bestimmungen dieser Rechtswissenschaft hÃ¤lt Platon (IV, 425) im Ganzen fÃ¼r Ã¼berflÃ¼ssig. In den BÃ¼chern Ã¼ber die Gesetze betrachtet er hauptsÃ¤chlich auch das Sittliche; doch lÃ¤ÃŸt er sich etwas mehr hierauf ein. Es erhellt hieraus, daÃŸ die Gerechtigkeit das ganze Wesen ist, â€“ in Ansehung des Einzelnen so bestimmt, daÃŸ jeder das, zu dem er geboren ist, aufs Beste treiben lerne und treibe. Hierdurch kommt er als bestimmte IndividualitÃ¤t allein zu seinem Rechte, sie ist im Allgemeinen des Staats; er gehÃ¶rt dem allgemeinen Geiste an und kommt zum Allgemeinen seiner als eines Diesen. Das Recht ist das Allgemeine mit einem bestimmten Inhalte, â€“ formell Allgemeines. Hier ist dieser Inhalt die bestimmte ganze IndividualitÃ¤t, nicht dies oder jenes Ding, Zufall des Besitzes; sondern seine eigentliche Habe ist der ausgebildete Besitz und Gebrauch seiner Natur. Die Gerechtigkeit lÃ¤ÃŸt Ã¼berhaupt jeder besonderen Bestimmung ihr Recht widerfahren und fÃ¼hrt sie ebenso ins Ganze zurÃ¼ck.[119] (Die PartikularitÃ¤t eines Individuums muÃŸ ausgebildet werden, zum Rechte, Dasein kommen. Jeder ist so an seiner Stelle, jeder erfÃ¼llt seine Bestimmung; so daÃŸ also jedem sein Recht widerfÃ¤hrt.) Sie heiÃŸt nach ihrem wahrhaften Begriff bei uns die Freiheit im subjektiven Sinn. Hier ist sie dies, daÃŸ das VernÃ¼nftige zu seinem Dasein komme, Existenz erhalte. Das Recht, daÃŸ die Freiheit zur Existenz komme, ist allgemein. Deswegen stellt Platon die Gerechtigkeit oben hin als Bestimmung des Ganzen und die Freiheit in dem Sinne, daÃŸ die vernÃ¼nftige Freiheit zur Existenz gelange durch den Organismus des Staats, â€“ eine Existenz, die dann eine notwendige, eine Weise der Natur ist.

> c) Das besondere Subjekt als Subjekt hat ebenso diese Eigenschaften an ihm; diese Momente des Subjekts entsprechen den drei realen Momenten des Staats. Diese dritte Form, in der diese Momente aufgezeigt werden, bestimmt Platon auf folgende Weise. (DaÃŸ ein Rhythmus, ein Typus die Idee im Staate ist, â€“ das ist eine groÃŸe und schÃ¶ne Grundlage des Platonischen Staates.) Â»Es zeigen sich am Subjekte zuerst Î±) BedÃ¼rfnisse, Begierden (epithymiai) wie Hunger und Durst, deren jede auf etwas Bestimmtes und nur auf dieses geht. Die Begierde, fÃ¼r die Arbeit, entspricht der Bestimmung des dritten Standes. Î²) Zugleich aber auch findet sich im einzelnen BewuÃŸtsein etwas anderes, was die Befriedigung dieser Begierde aufhÃ¤lt und hindert und Ã¼ber den Reiz zu derselben die Oberhand hat; dies ist der logos, das VernÃ¼nftige. Diesem entspricht der Stand der Vorsteher, die Weisheit des Staats. Î³) AuÃŸer diesen zwei Ideen der Seele ist ein Drittes, der Zorn (thymos), GemÃ¼t, welcher einesteils den Begierden verwandt ist, aber ebenso auch gegen die Begierde streitet und der Vernunft beisteht. Teils wenn einer Unrecht getan hat und der ihn Hunger und KÃ¤lte ausstehen lÃ¤ÃŸt, von dem er mit Recht dies zu leiden glaubt, so wird er, je edler er ist, desto weniger in Zorn gegen ihn entbrennen; teils, wenn er Unrecht leidet, so gÃ¤rt es in ihm auf, und er steht dem, was gerecht ist, bei, und Hunger und Frost[120] und sonstige MÃ¼hseligkeiten, die der Begierde entgegen sind, duldet er und Ã¼berwindet sie und gibt das Rechte nicht auf, bis er es durchgesetzt oder den Tod gefunden oder durch GrÃ¼nde, wie ein Hund vom SchÃ¤fer, besÃ¤nftigt ist. Der thymos; entspricht dem Stande der tapferen Verteidiger im Staate, wie diese fÃ¼r die Vernunft des Staats zu den Waffen greifen, so steht der Zorn der Vernunft bei, wenn er nicht durch schlechte Erziehung verderbt worden.Â« (IV, 437-441)

> Â»So ist also die Weisheit des Staats dasselbe als des Einzelnen; so auch die Tapferkeit, und so im Ãœbrigen: die MÃ¤ÃŸigung, die Ãœbereinstimmung der einzelnen Momente des NatÃ¼rlichen; und die Gerechtigkeit, wie in den Ã¤uÃŸeren Handlungen, daÃŸ jedes das Seinige vollbringt, so im Innern, daÃŸ jedes Moment des Geistes sein Recht erlangt und andere sich nicht in sein GeschÃ¤fte mischen, â€“ die Austeilung, welche jedem das Seinige gibt und es gewÃ¤hren lÃ¤ÃŸt.Â« (IV, 441-443) Wir haben den SchloÃŸ dreier Momente: Î±) die Allgemeinheit, Î²) die Mitte, der Zorn fÃ¼r sich gegen das GegenstÃ¤ndliche, in sich zurÃ¼ckkehrend und negativ, besser die negativ sich betÃ¤tigende Freiheit, Î³) die Vereinzelung. Platon ist auch hier, wo er kein BewuÃŸtsein seiner abstrakten Idee, wie beim Timaios, hat, diese in Wahrheit im Innern gegenwÃ¤rtig; und alles bildet sich darnach. Dies ist nun die Weise, wie Platon die Disposition fÃ¼r das Ganze macht. Die AusfÃ¼hrung ist Detail, das fÃ¼r sich weiter kein Interesse hat.

> Zweitens. Platon gibt dann die Mittel an, den Staat zu erhalten. Dies Mittel ist Erziehung, Bildung. Ãœberhaupt beruht nun das ganze Gemeinwesen auf Sitte, als zur Natur gewordenem Geist der Individuen, daÃŸ jeder als sittliches Tun und Wollen vorhanden sei. Wie bewirkt dies nun Platon? Eben wie macht er, daÃŸ in ihnen das, was ihre Bestimmung ist, wirklich zum eigenen Sein und Wollen des Individuums werde, daÃŸ jeder (nach der MÃ¤ÃŸigung) sich unterwerfe dieser seiner Stelle, GeschÃ¤fte? â€“ Die Hauptsache ist, die Individuen dazu zu erziehen. Er will diese[121] Sitte direkt hervorbringen in den Individuen, zuerst und vornehmlich in den WÃ¤chtern. Da den WÃ¤chtern gerade die Sorge Ã¼berlassen ist, diese Sitte hervorzubringen, so muÃŸ auf ihre Erziehung besonders geachtet werden, â€“ hernach auch auf die der Krieger. Wie es im Stande der Gewerbe sei, macht dem Staat wenig Sorge; Â»denn ob die Schuhflicker schlecht und verdorben werden und das nur zu sein scheinen, was sie sein sollen, â€“ das ist dem Staat kein UnglÃ¼ck (ouden deinon).Â« (IV, 421) Zum wichtigsten Teil des Ganzen gehÃ¶rt also die Bildung der Vorsteher, als Grundlage. Diese Bildung soll aber durch die Wissenschaft sein, durch die Kunde von dem philosophischen Wissen, von dem Allgemeinen, AnundfÃ¼rsichseienden, dessen Wissenschaft die Philosophie ist. Platon geht dabei die einzelnen Bildungsmittel durch: Religion, Kunst, Wissenschaft. AusfÃ¼hrlicher redet Platon auch ferner darÃ¼ber, wie weit Musik und Gymnastik als Mittel zuzulassen seien. Die Dichter aber, Homer und Hesiod, verbannt er aus seinem Staate, weil er ihre Vorstellungen von Gott unwÃ¼rdig findet. Denn es fing damals an, Ernst zu werden mit der Betrachtung des Glaubens an Jupiter und die Homerischen Geschichten; einzelne Darstellungen wurden als allgemeine Maxime, gÃ¶ttliches Gesetz genommen. Auf einer Stufe der Bildung sind KindermÃ¤rchen unschuldig; aber wenn sie zum Grunde der Wahrheit des Sittlichen gelegt werden sollen, als gegenwÃ¤rtiges Gesetz â€“ so Schriften der Israeliten, das Alte Testament, als MaÃŸstab im VÃ¶lkerrecht das Ausrotten der VÃ¶lker, die unzÃ¤hligen SchÃ¤ndlichkeiten, die David, der Mann Gottes, begangen, Greulichkeiten, welche die Priesterschaft (Samuel) gegen Saul verÃ¼bt und geltend gemacht hat â€“, dann ist es Zeit, sie zu einem Vergangenen, zu etwas bloÃŸ Historischem herabzusetzen. Platon geht die Gymnastik und Musik durch und spricht vorzÃ¼glich von der Philosophie. (II, 376) Dann will er Einleitungen in die Gesetze, worin die BÃ¼rger zu ihren Pflichten ermahnt, Ã¼berzeugt werden usf.; Erziehung, Wahl der Vortrefflichsten, kurz Sittlichkeit.[122]


> (Die WÃ¤chter wachen also fÃ¼r die Erhaltung der Gesetze, und die Gesetze beziehen sich besonders auf sie. Allerdings finden wir auch bei Platon Gesetze Ã¼ber Eigentum, Polizei usw. Â»AberÂ«, sagt er, Â»edlen und schÃ¶nen MÃ¤nnern darÃ¼ber Gesetze zu geben, verlohnt sich nicht der MÃ¼he.Â« (IV, 425) Wirklich, wie will man darÃ¼ber gÃ¶ttliche Gesetze erfinden, wo der Stoff an sich nur ZufÃ¤lligkeiten enthÃ¤lt?)
Hier ist aber der Zirkel vorhanden: Das Ã¶ffentliche Staatsleben besteht durch die Sitten, und umgekehrt die Sitten durch Institutionen. Die Sitten dÃ¼rfen nicht unabhÃ¤ngig von den Institutionen sein oder die Institutionen bloÃŸ auf die Sitten gerichtet sein durch Erziehungsanstalten, Religion. Eben Institutionen mÃ¼ssen als das Erste angesehen werden, wodurch die Sitte wird, die Weise, wie die Institutionen subjektiv sind. Platon selber gibt zu verstehen, wieviel Widerspruch er zu finden erwarte. Und noch jetzt pflegt man den Mangel darin zu setzen, daÃŸ er idealisch sei; darin liegt er vielmehr, daÃŸ er nicht idealisch genug ist. Denn wenn die Vernunft die allgemeine Macht ist, diese aber wesentlich geistig ist, so gehÃ¶rt zum Geistigen die subjektive Freiheit; und diese subjektive Freiheit ist das Prinzip, was schon bei Sokrates war, bei ihm aufgegangen und sich betÃ¤tigend als das, was das Verderben Griechenlands ausgemacht hat. Griechenland beruhte auf der substantiellen, sittlichen Freiheit; das ErblÃ¼hen der subjektiven Freiheit hat es nicht auszuhalten vermocht. Also die VernÃ¼nftigkeit soll die Grundlage des Gesetzes sein und ist es auch im ganzen; aber auf der andern Seite ist das Gewissen, die eigene Ãœberzeugung â€“ kurz alle Formen der subjektiven Freiheit â€“ wesentlich darin enthalten. Den Gesetzen, dem Staatsorganismus steht die SubjektivitÃ¤t gegenÃ¼ber. Jene Vernunft ist die absolute Macht, die das Individuum der Familie â€“ durch Ã¤uÃŸere Notwendigkeit der BedÃ¼rfnisse, worin aber Vernunft an und fÃ¼r sich â€“ sich anzueignenden Trieb hat. Es geht von der SubjektivitÃ¤t der freien WillkÃ¼r aus, schlieÃŸt sich dem Ganzen an, wÃ¤hlt sich einen Stand,[123] bringt sich empor als sittliche Sache. Aber dieses Moment Ã¼berhaupt, diese Bewegung des Individuums, dieses Prinzip der subjektiven Freiheit ist bei Platon teils nicht beachtet, teils sogar absichtlich verletzt, und er betrachtet nur, wie die Organisation des Staats die beste sei, nicht wie die subjektive IndividualitÃ¤t. Im Hinausgehen Ã¼ber das Prinzip der griechischen Sittlichkeit faÃŸt die Platonische Philosophie es zugleich auf und ging sogar darin noch weiter.
Was nun den anderen Gesichtspunkt betrifft, das AusschlieÃŸendes Prinzips der subjektiven Freiheit, so ist dies ein Hauptzug bei der Platonischen Republik. Der Geist derselben besteht wesentlich darin, daÃŸ alle Seiten, worin sich die Einzelheit als solche fixiert, im Allgemeinen aufgelÃ¶st werden, â€“ alle nur als allgemeine Menschen gelten. Dieser Bestimmung gemÃ¤ÃŸ, das Prinzip der SubjektivitÃ¤t auszuschlieÃŸen, ist es nun, daÃŸ Platon (spezieller)
a) es nicht den Individuen gestattet, sich einen Stand zu wÃ¤hlen, â€“ was wir fÃ¼r die Freiheit als notwendig fordern. Diese StÃ¤nde sind aber in Ansehung der Individuen nicht durch die Geburt getrennt und fÃ¼r sie bestimmt; sondern je nachdem einer natÃ¼rliches Geschick und Anlage hat (nach dem Urteile Ã¼ber seine Talente, Erziehung), wird von den Regenten des Staats, den Ã„ltesten des ersten Standes, welche die Individuen erziehen lassen, prÃ¼fen, die Auswahl und die Abscheidung gemacht und jeder einem bestimmten GeschÃ¤fte zugeteilt (III, 412-415). (Der erste Stand sind Regenten, die Weisheit des Staats, und haben die Krieger auf ihrer Seite als BetÃ¤tigung, aber so, daÃŸ nicht ein Zivil- und MilitÃ¤rstand auseinanderfÃ¤llt, sondern beides vereine ist, â€“ so daÃŸ die Ã„ltesten die WÃ¤chter. Dies erscheint unserem Prinzip durchaus widersprechend. Denn obwohl man es fÃ¼r billig findet, daÃŸ zu einem gewissen Stande eine besondere TÃ¤tigkeit und Geschicklichkeit gehÃ¶re, so bleibt es doch[124] immer eine Neigung, welchem Stande man angehÃ¶rt; und mit dieser Neigung â€“ frei scheinenden Wahl â€“ macht der Stand sich fÃ¼r sich selber. Aber von einem anderen Individuum lÃ¤ÃŸt man sich das nicht vorschreiben: Â»Weil du zu nichts Besserem zu brauchen bist als zu einem HandwerkerÂ« usw. Er kann es selbst versuchen; man muÃŸ ihn machen lassen, Ã¼ber ihn als Subjekt auch auf subjektive Weise entscheiden lassen durch eigene WillkÃ¼r, ohnehin nach Ã¤uÃŸeren UmstÃ¤nden: Â»Ich will auf das Studieren mich legen.Â«
b) Ferner kommt es aus dieser Bestimmung her, daÃŸ Platon ebenso in seinem Staate das Prinzip des Privateigentums Ã¼berhaupt aufgehoben hat (III, 416-417). Denn in ihm wird die Einzelheit, das einzelne BewuÃŸtsein absolut, oder die Person angesehen als das Ansichseiende ohne allen Inhalt. Im Recht als solchem gelte ich als Dieser an und fÃ¼r mich. Es gelten alle so, und ich gelte nur, weil alle gelten, oder ich gelte nur als Allgemeines; aber der Inhalt dieser Allgemeinheit ist die fixierte Einzelheit. Wenn es im Recht um das Recht als solches zu tun ist, den Richtern der Sache nichts daran gelegen ist, ob eigentlich dieser oder ein anderer dies Haus besitze, und auch den Parteien nichts am Besitze dieses Dings, um das sie streiten, sondern am Recht um des Rechts willen (wie der MoralitÃ¤t an der Pflicht um der Pflicht willen), so wird an dieser Abstraktion festgehalten und von dem Inhalt der RealitÃ¤t abstrahiert. Aber das Allgemeine der Philosophie ist nicht eine Abstraktion, sondern das Wesen der Einheit des Allgemeinen und der RealitÃ¤t oder seines Inhalts. Es gilt daher nur der Inhalt, insofern er im Allgemeinen negativ gesetzt wird, zurÃ¼ckkehrend, nicht an und fÃ¼r sich geltend. Insofern ich die Dinge brauche â€“ nicht insofern ich sie habe oder sie mir als seiend, als fixiert an mir als Fixiertem gelten â€“, stehen die Dinge in Beziehung auf mich als Besitz und Eigentum. â€“ Der (andere) dritte Stand aber treibt Handwerke, Handel, Ackerbau und schafft das NÃ¶tige fÃ¼r das Allgemeine herbei, ohne Eigentum durch seine Arbeit zu gewinnen; sondern das Ganze ist eine[125] Familie, worin jeder sein angewiesenes GeschÃ¤ft treibt, aber das Produkt der Arbeit gemeinsam ist und er von seinem sowie von allen Produkten das erhÃ¤lt, was er braucht. Eigentum ist ein Besitz, der mir als dieser Person angehÃ¶rt, worin meine Person als solche zur Existenz, zur RealitÃ¤t kommt. Aus diesem Grunde schlieÃŸt er es aus. Es bleibt aber unerÃ¶rtert, wie in Entwicklung der Gewerbe ohne Hoffnung auf Privateigentum ein Reiz der TÃ¤tigkeit stattfinden soll. Darin, daÃŸ ich Person bin, liegt ja vielmehr meine FÃ¤higkeit zum Eigentum. â€“ DaÃŸ dann, wie Platon meint (V, 464), allen Streitigkeiten, Zwist, HaÃŸ, Habsucht usf. ein Ende gemacht sei, kann man sieh wohl im allgemeinen vorstellen. Aber das ist nur eine untergeordnete Folge gegen das hÃ¶here und vernÃ¼nftige Prinzip des Eigentumsrechts; und die Freiheit hat nur Dasein, sofern der Person Eigentum zukommt. Auf diese Weise sehen wir die subjektive Freiheit von Platon selbst mit BewuÃŸtsein aus seinem Staate entfernt.
c) Aus demselben Grunde hebt Platon auch die Ehe auf, weil sie eine Verbindung ist, worin eine Person von einem Geschlechte einer Person vom anderen sich als diese gegenseitig bleibend angehÃ¶rt, auch auÃŸer der bloÃŸ natÃ¼rlichen Beziehung, â€“ dem Â»gegenseitigen GebraucheÂ«, wenn es so genannt werden kann. Platon lÃ¤ÃŸt das Familienleben in seinem Staate nicht aufkommen, â€“ diese EigentÃ¼mlichkeit, wonach eine Familie ein Ganzes fÃ¼r sich ausmacht. Die Familie ist die erweiterte PersÃ¶nlichkeit, â€“ ein sittliches VerhÃ¤ltnis, innerhalb der natÃ¼rlichen Sittlichkeit, ausschlieÃŸend gegen Anderes; es ist zwar Sittlichkeit, aber eine solche, die dem Individuum als Einzelheit zugehÃ¶rt. Nach dem Begriff der subjektiven Freiheit muÃŸ das Individuum Eigentum haben; ebenso notwendig, ja heilig ist die Familie. So lÃ¤ÃŸt Platon der Mutter das Kind gleich nach der Geburt wegnehmen, in einer eigenen Anstalt (Schafstall) zusammenbringen und durch SÃ¤ugammen aus der Zahl der MÃ¼tter, die entbunden worden, nÃ¤hren, â€“ so jedoch, daÃŸ keine Mutter mehr ihr Kind soll erkennen kÃ¶nnen. Die[126] Kinder erhalten eine gemeinsame Erziehung. Ebenso werden auch die Frauen verteilt. Es soll wohl Hochzeiten, besondere Frauen geben, â€“ aber so, daÃŸ das Zusammen sein von Mann und Frau nicht eine persÃ¶nliche Neigung voraussetzt, das Individuum nicht sein besonderes Gefallen gelten machen kann, welches Mann und Frau fÃ¼reinander bestimmt. Die Weiber sollen vom 20. bis 40. Jahre gebÃ¤ren, die MÃ¤nner vom 30. bis 55. Jahre Frauen haben. Um Blutschande zu verhindern, sollen die Kinder, die zu der Zeit geboren, wo ein Mann verheiratet ist, alle seine Kinder genannt werden (V, 457-461). Die Frauen, deren wesentliche Bestimmung das Familienleben ist, entbehren hier dieses ihres Bodens. In der Platonischen Republik folgt daher: Indem die Familie aufgelÃ¶st ist und die Weiber nicht mehr dem Hause vorstehen, so sind sie auch keine Privatpersonen und nehmen die Weise des Mannes als des allgemeinen Individuums im Staate an. Und Platon lÃ¤ÃŸt sie deswegen alle mÃ¤nnlichen Arbeiten wie diese verrichten (V, 451-457), auch mit in den Krieg ziehen, setzt sie auf beinahe gleichen FuÃŸ mit den MÃ¤nnern; aber er hat kein sonderliches Zutrauen zu ihrer Tapferkeit und stellt sie nur hinterdrein, und zwar nicht als Reserve, doch Â»als arriÃ¨re-garde, um wenigstens dem Feinde durch die Menge Furcht einzujagen, zu imponieren und im Notfall auch zu Hilfe zu eilenÂ« (V, 471).

> Dies macht nun die GrundzÃ¼ge der Platonischen Republik aus. Sie hat dies Wesentliche, daÃŸ das Prinzip der Einzelheit unterdrÃ¼ckt ist, und es scheint, daÃŸ die Idee dies erfordere, daÃŸ eben hierin der Gegensatz der Philosophie Ã¼berhaupt gegen die Vorstellungsweise liegt, welche das Einzelne geltend macht und so auch im Staate, als dem realen Geiste, Eigentumsrecht, Schutz der Personen und des Eigentums sogar als die Basis alles Staats ansieht. Das ist die Grenze der Platonischen Idee; jenes nur die abstrakte Idee. Aber in der Tat ist die wahre Idee eben diese, daÃŸ jedes Moment sich vollkommen realisiert, verkÃ¶rpert und selbstÃ¤ndig macht und in seiner SelbstÃ¤ndigkeit fÃ¼r den Geist doch ein Aufgehobenes[127] ist. Hiernach muÃŸ nach dieser Idee die Einzelheit sich vollkommen realisieren, ihr Feld und Reich im Staate haben und doch in ihm aufgelÃ¶st sein. Das Element des Staats ist die Familie, d.h. sie ist der natÃ¼rliche, vernunftlose Staat; dies Element muÃŸ als solches vorhanden sein. Alsdann die Idee des Vernunftstaats hat die Momente ihres Begriffs so zu realisieren, daÃŸ sie StÃ¤nde werden, daÃŸ die sittliche Substanz in Massen sich zerteilt, wie die kÃ¶rperliche Substanz in Eingeweide und Organe, deren jedes das Leben in eigentÃ¼mlicher Bestimmtheit treibt, aber alle nur ein Leben zusammen ausmachen. Der Staat Ã¼berhaupt, das Ganze, als Einzelwesen, noch nicht abstrakte Allgemeinheit der PersÃ¶nlichkeit, die das Recht ausmacht, muÃŸ durch alles hindurchgehen. Aber ebenso muÃŸ das abstrakt Formelle, das Recht mit der Einzelheit als seiendem In halt, Prinzip, durchs Ganze hindurchlaufen; aber ein Stand gehÃ¶rt ihm besonders an. So muÃŸ auch ein Stand sein, worin das unmittelbare Eigentum, das bleibende Eigentum, wie der Besitz des Leibes, so ein Besitz eines StÃ¼cks Land ist, â€“ und dann ein Stand worin immer erworben wird, nicht solcher unmittelbarer Besitz ist, sondern ein sich immer wandelndes und verÃ¤nderndes Gut. Diese beiden StÃ¤nde gibt das Volk als einen Teil seiner selbst dem Prinzip der Einzelheit preis und lÃ¤ÃŸt hier das Recht regieren, eine BestÃ¤ndigkeit, das Allgemeine das Ansich in diesem Prinzipe suchen, das vielmehr das der Beweglichkeit ist. Dies Prinzip muÃŸ seine ganze vollstÃ¤ndige RealitÃ¤t haben, es muÃŸ auch als Eigentum vorkommen. Dies ist erst der wahre reale Geist, daÃŸ jedes Moment seine vollkommene SelbstÃ¤ndigkeit und er sein Anderssein in vÃ¶lliger GleichgÃ¼ltigkeit des Seins erhÃ¤lt; â€“ dies vermag die Natur nicht, selbstÃ¤ndiges Leben ihrer Teile darzustellen auÃŸer im groÃŸen Systeme.
Dies ist, wie wir sonst sehen werden, die groÃŸe Erhebung der modernen Welt Ã¼ber die alte, worin das GegenstÃ¤ndliche grÃ¶ÃŸere, absolute SelbstÃ¤ndigkeit erhÃ¤lt, die aber darum um so schwerer unter die Einheit der Idee zurÃ¼ckkehrt.[128]
Dieser Mangel der SubjektivitÃ¤t ist der Mangel der griechischen sittlichen Idee selbst. Das Prinzip, was bei Sokrates aufging, war nur bisher untergeordneter vorhanden; es muÃŸ nun auch absolutes Prinzip, notwendiges Moment der Idee selbst werden.

> Durch dies AusschlieÃŸendes Eigentums, des Familienlebens, durch die Aufhebung der WillkÃ¼r bei Wahl des Standes, durch alle diese Bestimmungen, die sich auf das Prinzip der subjektiven Freiheit beziehen, glaubt Platon allen Leidenschaften, HaÃŸ, Streit usf. die TÃ¼r verschlossen zu haben. Er hatte wohl erkannt, daÃŸ das Verderben des griechischen Lebens davon hergekommen ist, daÃŸ die Individuen als solche ihre Zwecke, ihre Neigungen, Interessen geltend zu machen anfingen, Interessen, die Ã¼ber den gemeinsamen Geist Meister geworden sind. Indem dies Prinzip aber notwendig ist durch die christliche Religion â€“ in der die Seele des Einzelnen absoluter Zweck ist und so als notwendig im Begriff des Geistes eingetreten ist in die Welt â€“, so sieht man, daÃŸ die Platonische Staatsverfassung untergeordnet ist, das nicht erfÃ¼llen kann, was die hÃ¶here Forderung von einem sittlichen Organismus verlangt. Platon hat das Beruhen, Wissen, Wollen, BeschlieÃŸen des Individuums nicht anerkannt, nicht zu vereinigen gewuÃŸt mit seiner Idee. Die Gerechtigkeit erfordert ebenso fÃ¼r dies sein Recht wie die hÃ¶here AuflÃ¶sung und Harmonie mit dem Allgemeinen. Das Entgegengesetzte gegen das Prinzip Platons ist das Prinzip des bewuÃŸten freien Willens der Einzelnen, was in spÃ¤terer Zeit besonders durch Rousseau obenangestellt worden ist: daÃŸ die WillkÃ¼r des Einzelnen als Einzelnen, das Aussprechen des Einzelnen notwendig ist. Da ist denn das Prinzip bis in das direkte Extrem gesteigert und in seiner ganzen Einseitigkeit hervorgetreten. Dieser WillkÃ¼r und Bildung gegenÃ¼ber muÃŸ das an und fÃ¼r sich Allgemeine, Gedachte, nicht als weise Vorsteher, Sitte, sondern als Gesetz, und zugleich mein Wesen und mein Gedanke, d.h. SubjektivitÃ¤t und Einzelheit sein. Die Menschen mÃ¼ssen das VernÃ¼nftige[129] selbst aus sich mit ihrem Interesse, ihrer Leidenschaft hervorgebracht haben, so wie es in die Wirklichkeit tritt durch dringende Not, Gelegenheit, Veranlassungen.
Wir haben auch nicht den Kritias anzufÃ¼hren, der ein Fragment geblieben ist und im Zusammenhange mit Timaios steht, mit dem sich Kritias so geteilt hatte, daÃŸ Timaios von dem spekulativen Ursprung des Menschen und der Natur handeln, Kritias die Geschichte der Menschenbildung (philosophische Geschichte) als die alte Geschichte der Athenienser darstellen sollte, wie sie bei den Ã„gyptern aufbewahrt werde.
Noch kann eine berÃ¼hmte Seite der Platonischen Philosophie kurz betrachtet werden, nÃ¤mlich das Ã„sthetische, die Erkenntnis dessen, was das SchÃ¶ne ist. HierÃ¼ber hat Platon ebenso den einzigen wahren Gedanken aufgefaÃŸt, daÃŸ das Wesen des SchÃ¶nen intellektuell, die Idee der Vernunft ist. Er ist so zu verstehen, wenn er von einer geistigen SchÃ¶nheit spricht: Die SchÃ¶nheit als SchÃ¶nheit ist die sinnliche SchÃ¶nheit, nicht an einem anderen Orte, man weiÃŸ nicht wo; sondern was am Sinnlichen schÃ¶n ist, ist eben geistig. Es ist dies der Fall wie mit seiner Idee Ã¼berhaupt. Wie das Wesen und die Wahrheit des Erscheinenden die Idee ist, so ist auch die Wahrheit des erscheinenden SchÃ¶nen eben diese Idee. Das VerhÃ¤ltnis zum KÃ¶rperlichen, als ein VerhÃ¤ltnis der Begierde oder des Angenehmen und NÃ¼tzlichen, ist kein VerhÃ¤ltnis zu ihm als SchÃ¶nem; es ist ein VerhÃ¤ltnis zu ihm als dem nur Sinnlichen oder des Einzelnen zu Einzelnem. Sondern das Wesen des SchÃ¶nen ist nur die auf sinnliche Weise als ein Ding vorhandene einfache Idee der Vernunft; aber sein Inhalt ist nichts anderes als sie. Es ist wesentlich ein geistiges Wesen; Î±) es ist nicht bloÃŸ sinnliches Ding, sondern die der Form der Allgemeinheit, der Wahrheit unterworfene Wirklichkeit. Aber Î²) dies Allgemeine behÃ¤lt auch nicht die Form[130] der Allgemeinheit, sondern das Allgemeine ist Inhalt, dessen Form die sinnliche Weise ist, â€“ Bestimmtheit des SchÃ¶nen. In der Wissenschaft hat das Allgemeine auch wieder die Form des Allgemeinen oder des Begriffs. Das SchÃ¶ne aber tritt als wirkliches Ding oder in der Sprache als Vorstellung hervor, in der Weise [wie] das Dingliche im Geiste ist. Die Natur, das Wesen usf., der Inhalt des SchÃ¶nen wird allein durch die Vernunft erkannt, â€“ derselbe Inhalt, den die Philosophie hat; und das SchÃ¶ne ist seinem Wesen nach allein durch sie zu beurteilen. Weil sie im SchÃ¶nen auf dingliche Weise erscheint, so bleibt das SchÃ¶ne unter der Erkenntnis; und Platon hat eben deswegen seine wahre Erscheinung als das Geistige, wo sie in Geistes Weise ist, in die Erkenntnis gesetzt.


> Dies wÃ¤re der Hauptinhalt der Platonischen Philosophie. Der Platonische Standpunkt ist Î±) zufÃ¤llige Form, â€“ GesprÃ¤che, Unterhaltung edler Geister, freier Menschen, ohne anderes Interesse als die Theorie, geistiges Leben; Î²) sie kommen dabei, fortgefÃ¼hrt durch den Inhalt, auf die tiefsten Begriffe, â€“ schÃ¶ne Stellen, tiefe Gedanken, wie Edelsteine, auf die man stÃ¶ÃŸt, nicht in einer SandwÃ¼ste, freilich auf trockenem Gange, Blumengefilde, aber auf mÃ¼hsamem Wege (Edelsteine, Blumen, wie erheiternde Natur); Î³) nicht systematischer Zusammenhang, â€“ mit einem Interesse; Î´) nicht SubjektivitÃ¤t des Begriffes Ã¼berhaupt, aber Îµ) substantielle Idee.
Platons Philosophie hatte zwei Stufen, nach welchen sie sich ausbilden und in ein hÃ¶heres Prinzip hinaufarbeiten muÃŸte. Î±) Das Allgemeine, welches in der Vernunft ist, muÃŸte im stÃ¤rksten unendlichen Gegensatz sich entzweien, in SelbstÃ¤ndigkeit des persÃ¶nlichen BewuÃŸtseins, das fÃ¼r sich ist. So geht in der Neuen Akademie das SelbstbewuÃŸtsein in sich zurÃ¼ck und wird eine Art von Skeptizismus, â€“ die negative Vernunft, welche Ã¼berhaupt gegen alles Allgemeine sich wendet und die Einheit des SelbstbewuÃŸtseins und des[131] Allgemeinen nicht zu finden weiÃŸ, daher an jenem stehenbleibt. Î²) Die Neuplatoniker aber machen die RÃ¼ckkehr, diese Einheit des SelbstbewuÃŸtseins und des absoluten Wesens; ihnen ist Gott in der Vernunft unmittelbar gegenwÃ¤rtig, â€“ das vernÃ¼nftige Erkennen ist selbst der gÃ¶ttliche Geist und sein Inhalt das Wesen Gottes. Beides werden wir spÃ¤terhin sehen.

###### 1. Metaphysics

> Das Allgemeine seines Begriffs ist anzugeben. Seine spekulative Idee ist vorzÃ¼glich aus den BÃ¼chern der Metaphysik zu schÃ¶pfen. Allein diese hat die ganz eigene Schwierigkeit in ihrer Zusammensetzung, daÃŸ entweder mehrere Schriften in eins zusammengefÃ¼gt; oder, wenn der KÃ¶rper dieser Schrift so eins ist, wie es auch wieder wegen des allgemeinen Zusammenhangs scheint, so kann nicht gesagt werden, daÃŸ ordnungsmÃ¤ÃŸig und klar verfahren sei. Metaphysik ist nicht ein Name des Aristoteles, auch von Ã„lteren ist sein Werk nicht unter diesem Namen gekannt; was bei uns Metaphysik, hieÃŸ Aristoteles prÃ´tÃª philosophia.

> Die reine Philosophie oder Metaphysik unterscheidet Aristoteles sehr bestimmt von den anderen Wissenschaften als Â»die Wissenschaft dessen, was ist, insofern es ist, und was ihm an und fÃ¼r sich selbst zukommtÂ« (IV, 1). Auf die Bestimmung dessen, was nun dies Wesen ist â€“ diese Substanz (ousia) zu erkennen â€“, geht Aristoteles vorzÃ¼glich (VII, 1). In dieser Ontologie oder, wie wir es nennen, Logik untersucht und unterscheidet er genau die vier Prinzipien: Î±) die Bestimmtheit oder QualitÃ¤t als solche, wodurch etwas Dieses ist; Î²) die Materie (hylÃª); Î³) das Prinzip der Bewegung; und b) das Prinzip des Zwecks oder des Guten (I, 3).

> Die Idee des Aristoteles ist unterschieden von der des Platon. Und zwar bestimmt Platon die Idee als das Gute, als den Zweck, als das Allgemeine Ã¼berhaupt; Aristoteles aber geht weiter. Wir haben davon gesprochen, daÃŸ die Idee bei Platon in sich wesentlich konkret, in sich bestimmt ist. Insofern die Idee nun in sich selbst bestimmt ist, so ist das VerhÃ¤ltnis der Momente in ihr nÃ¤her zu fassen, herauszuheben, und diese Beziehung der Bestimmungen aufeinander ist nun als TÃ¤tigkeit Ã¼berhaupt aufzufassen. Uns ist gelÃ¤ufig, das Mangelhafte von dergleichen im BewuÃŸtsein zu haben, das Mangelhafte der Idee, des Allgemeinen, des Gedankens, des Begriffs, dessen, was nur an sich ist. Das Allgemeine hat damit, daÃŸ es Allgemeines ist, noch keine Wirklichkeit; die TÃ¤tigkeit der Verwirklichung ist noch nicht gesetzt, das Ansich ist so ein TrÃ¤ges. Vernunft, Gesetze usf. sind so abstrakt; aber das VernÃ¼nftige, als sich verwirklichend, erkennen wir als notwendig, â€“ um auf solch Allgemeines, solche Vernunft, solche Gesetze soviel zu halten. Das Platonische ist im Allgemeinen das Objektive, aber das Prinzip der Lebendigkeit, das Prinzip der SubjektivitÃ¤t fehlt darin; und dies Prinzip der Lebendigkeit, der SubjektivitÃ¤t, nicht in dem Sinne einer zufÃ¤lligen, nur besonderen SubjektivitÃ¤t, sondern der reinen SubjektivitÃ¤t ist Aristoteles eigentÃ¼mlich.

> So ist bei Aristoteles auch das Gute, der Zweck, das Allgemeine die Grundlage, das Substantielle; und dies Allgemeine, den Zweck macht er geltend, hÃ¤lt ihn fest im Gegensatz gegen Heraklit und gegen die Eleaten. Das Werden des Heraklit ist eine richtige, wesentliche Bestimmung; aber die VerÃ¤nderung entbehrt noch der Bestimmung der IdentitÃ¤t mit sich, der Festigkeit, der Allgemeinheit. Der Strom verÃ¤ndert sich immer, aber er ist auch perennierend â€“ und ist noch mehr ein Bild, eine allgemeine Existenz; woraus denn sogleich sichtbar ist, daÃŸ er vorzÃ¼glich gegen Heraklit und andere streitet, daÃŸ Sein und Nichtsein nicht dasselbe ist, oder den berÃ¼hmten Satz des Widerspruchs begrÃ¼ndet, daÃŸ ein Mensch nicht zugleich ein Schiff sei (IV, 3-6). Es erhellt sogleich, daÃŸ Aristoteles nicht das reine Sein oder Nichtsein versteht, diese Abstraktion, die wesentlich nur das Ãœbergehen des einen in das andere ist; sondern unter dem, was ist, versteht er wesentlich die Substanz, Idee. Aristoteles fragt nur nach dem, was das Bewegende ist; und dies ist der logos, der Zweck. Wie er gegen das Prinzip der bloÃŸen VerÃ¤nderung das Allgemeine festhÃ¤lt, so macht er im Gegenteil, gegen die Pythagoreer und gegen Platon, gegen die Zahl die TÃ¤tigkeit geltend. TÃ¤tigkeit ist auch VerÃ¤nderung, aber VerÃ¤nderung als identisch mit sich bleibend, â€“ ist VerÃ¤nderung, aber innerhalb des Allgemeinen gesetzt als die sich selbst gleiche VerÃ¤nderung, â€“ ist ein Bestimmen, welches ist Sichselbstbestimmen. In der bloÃŸen VerÃ¤nderung ist dagegen das Erhalten seiner in der VerÃ¤nderung noch nicht enthalten. Das Allgemeine ist tÃ¤tig, bestimmt sich; und der Zweck ist das Sichselbstbestimmen, was sich realisiert. Dies ist die Hauptbestimmung, auf die es bei Aristoteles ankommt.


> Das NÃ¤here sind nun die zwei Hauptformen, welche er bestimmt: Î±) als die der MÃ¶glichkeit (dynamis, potentia) und Î²) der Wirklichkeit (energeia, actus), noch bestimmter der Entelechie (entelecheia), welches in sich Zweck und Realisierung des Zwecks ist. Dies sind Bestimmungen, die allenthalben bei Aristoteles vorkommen (IX, 1-7; etc.) und die man kennen muÃŸ, um ihn zu fassen. Der Hauptbegriff der Substanz ist, daÃŸ sie nicht nur Materie ist (VII, 3). Alles Seiende enthÃ¤lt Materie, alle VerÃ¤nderung erfordert ein Substrat (hypokeimenon), an dem sie vorgeht. Die Materie selbst aber ist nur die Potenz, eine MÃ¶glichkeit, sie ist nur dynamei, â€“ nicht die Wirklichkeit, dies ist die Form; daÃŸ sie wahrhaft sei, dazu gehÃ¶rt Form, TÃ¤tigkeit (VIII, 1-2). Dynamis heiÃŸt gar nicht Kraft bei Aristoteles (Kraft ist vielmehr unvollkommene Gestalt der Form), sondern mehr MÃ¶glichkeit, VermÃ¶gen, nicht die unbestimmte MÃ¶glichkeit; energeia aber ist die reine Wirksamkeit aus sich selbst. Durch das ganze Mittelalter waren diese Bestimmungen wichtig. Dynamis ist Anlage, das Ansich, das Objektive bei Aristoteles; dann das abstrakt Allgemeine Ã¼berhaupt, die Idee, sie ist nur potentia. Erst die Energie, die Form ist die TÃ¤tigkeit, das Verwirklichende, die sich auf sich beziehende NegativitÃ¤t. Wenn wir dagegen sagen Â»das WesenÂ«, so ist damit noch nicht TÃ¤tigkeit gesetzt; Wesen ist nur an sich, ist nur MÃ¶glichkeit, ist ohne unendliche Form. Die Materie ist nur das, was an sich ist; denn wenn sie alle Formen annehmen kann, so ist sie eben nicht selbst das formierende Prinzip. Dabei hat die wesentlich absolute Substanz MÃ¶glichkeit und Wirklichkeit, Form und Materie nicht voneinander getrennt. Die Materie ist nur eine MÃ¶glichkeit, die Form gibt ihr die Wirklichkeit; aber so ist Form nicht ohne Materie oder die MÃ¶glichkeit, â€“ die Materie ist gewÃ¶hnlich im gemeinen Leben das Substantielle. Energie ist konkreter SubjektivitÃ¤t, MÃ¶glichkeit das Objektive; das wahrhaft[154] Objektive hat allerdings auch TÃ¤tigkeit in sich, wie das wahrhaft Subjektive auch dynamis.

> Aus dieser Bestimmung erhellt eine Art des Gegensatzes der Aristotelischen Idee gegen die Platonische. Aristoteles polemisiert oft gegen die Zahlen und Ideen. Platon drÃ¼ckt das Wesen mehr als das Allgemeine aus, wodurch das Moment der Wirklichkeit ihm zu fehlen oder wenigstens in den Hintergrund zu stehen zu kommen scheint. Und in der Tat ist dies negative Prinzip auch nicht so unmittelbar ausgedrÃ¼ckt, aber wesentlich ist es daran, wenn es die Einheit Entgegengesetzter ist; denn diese Einheit ist wesentlich negative dieser Entgegengesetzten, was ihr Anderssein, Entgegensetzung aufhebt und sie in sich zurÃ¼ckfÃ¼hrt. Was als Wirklichkeit, Energie ausgedrÃ¼ckt ist, ist eben diese NegativitÃ¤t, TÃ¤tigkeit, tÃ¤tige Wirksamkeit: sich selbst, dieses FÃ¼rsichsein entzweien, die Einheit aufheben und die Entzweiung setzen, â€“ nicht mehr FÃ¼rsichsein, sondern Sein-fÃ¼r-Anderes, also NegativitÃ¤t gegen die Einheit. Die Idee ist mehr: das Aufheben der Entgegengesetzten, aber eins der Entgegengesetzten ist selbst die Einheit. Wenn bei Platon das affirmative Prinzip, die Idee als nur abstrakt sich selbst gleich, das Ãœberwiegende ist, so ist bei Aristoteles das Moment der NegativitÃ¤t, aber nicht als VerÃ¤nderung, auch nicht als Nichts, sondern als Unterscheiden, Bestimmen hinzugekommen und von ihm herausgehoben. (Vgl. VII, 13)

Was Aristoteles gegen die Platonischen Ideen einwendet, ist weitlÃ¤ufig (I, 7, 9). Er findet diese Prinzipien nicht genÃ¼gend. (Wir sahen oben schon, daÃŸ auch Aristoteles das Allgemeine, den Zweck, aber hauptsÃ¤chlich das Prinzip der Individuation aufstellt.) Die TÃ¤tigkeit, Wirklichkeit sei nicht in ihnen zu finden; daÃŸ die wirklichen Dinge teilhaben an den Ideen (paradeigmata), sei leeres Gerede (kenologein) und Metaphern. Es gebe so viele Bestimmtheiten als Dinge. Es enthalte WidersprÃ¼che, selbstÃ¤ndige Gattungen anzunehmen: Sokrates, Mensch, zweifÃ¼ÃŸig, Tier.
Aristoteles unterscheidet an der Substanz, insofern die Momente TÃ¤tigkeit und MÃ¶glichkeit nicht in eins, sondern noch getrennt erscheinen, mannigfache Momente. Die nÃ¤here Bestimmung dieses VerhÃ¤ltnisses der Form zur Materie, der Energie zur MÃ¶glichkeit, und die Bewegung dieses Gegensatzes gibt die unterschiedenen Weisen der Substanz. Hier geht Aristoteles nun die Substanzen durch, und sie erscheinen bei ihm mehr als eine Reihe von verschiedenen Arten der Substanzen, nacheinander betrachtet, als in ein System zusammengebracht. Deren sind einige Hauptbestimmungen unter anderen folgende drei Momente.

> a) Â»Die sinnliche empfindbare SubstanzÂ« (XII, 1-2; VII, 7), eine endliche Substanz, ist nur nach dieser Form, die die einer Materie hat, von der die Form unterschieden ist, eine Ã¤uÃŸerliche ist. Dies macht die Natur des Endlichen Ã¼berhaupt aus, Trennung der Form, des Ã„uÃŸerlichen, von der Materie; die Form an ihr ist auch das Wirksame, der Form kommt die TÃ¤tigkeit zu, â€“ aber sie ist hier Ã¤uÃŸerlich, unterschieden von der Materie. Â»Die sinnliche SubstanzÂ«, sagt Aristoteles, Â»hat die VerÃ¤nderung an ihr, aber so, daÃŸ sie in das Entgegengesetzte Ã¼bergeht. Eins dieser Entgegengesetzten bleibt, das andere verschwindet; das Dritte auÃŸer diesen Entgegengesetzten, was sich erhÃ¤lt, das Dauernde in dieser VerÃ¤nderung ist die Materie. Â« Die Hauptkategorien, die er nennt, sind die vier Unterschiede, nÃ¤mlich Î±) nach dem Was (kata to ti) â€“ eidos, dem Zweck, der einfachen Bestimmung â€“, Î²) oder nach der QualitÃ¤t (poion), den weiteren Eigenschaften, Î³) oder QuantitÃ¤t (poson, Î´) oder Wo (pou). Es sind die Kategorien von Î±) Entstehung und Untergang nach dem Was (kata tode), dem bestimmten Wesen; Î²) Vermehrung und Verminderung nach der QuantitÃ¤t; Î³) VerÃ¤nderung nach den Eigenschaften (pathos) â€“ wohl nach dem poion; Î´) Bewegung nach dem Orte. Die Materie ist das tote Substrat, das Subjekt, Â»die Grundlage, an der die VerÃ¤nderung vorgehtÂ«; die Materie leidet VerÃ¤nderungen. Â»Die VerÃ¤nderung selbst ist aus dem, was der MÃ¶glichkeit nach ist, in die Wirklichkeit; das mÃ¶gliche WeiÃŸe verÃ¤ndert sich ins wirkliche WeiÃŸe. Nicht aus dem Nichts entstehen nach Zufall die Dinge; sondern alles entsteht aus einem SeiendenÂ« â€“ IdentitÃ¤t. Â»Das MÃ¶gliche heiÃŸt also selbst ein SeiendesÂ«; dies, als allgemein in sich Seiendes, bringt diese Bestimmungen herbei, ohne eine aus der anderen aufzuzeigen. Â»Die Materie ist das Einfache, -die MÃ¶glichkeitÂ« (nÃ¤her bestimmt) Â»ist dieselbe, aber als entgegengesetzt; etwas wird nur diese Materie in der Wirklichkeit, das seine Materie auch der MÃ¶glichkeit nach war.Â« Es ist also gesetzt: Î±) Materie, das allgemeine Wesen, Substrat der VerÃ¤nderung, gleichgÃ¼ltig gegen das Entgegengesetzte; Î²) die Bestimmtheiten, das Negative, gegeneinander; Î³) das Bewegende, die reine TÃ¤tigkeit. So erscheinen an der sinnlichen Substanz die Momente verschieden, aber noch nicht die RÃ¼ckkehr in sich; aber die TÃ¤tigkeit ist das Negative, welches ideell das Entgegengesetzte in sich enthÃ¤lt (eins aufhebt), â€“ also schon auch das, was werden soll.

> b) Eine hÃ¶here Art (IX, 2; VII, 7; XII, 3) ist die, wo die TÃ¤tigkeit hereinkommt, die Energie, der actus Ã¼berhaupt, das abstrakt Negative, aber enthaltend das, was werden soll; die sinnliche Gestalt an ihr ist nur die VerÃ¤nderung. Insofern also nun die TÃ¤tigkeit das enthÃ¤lt, was werden soll, ist sie der Verstand (nous), und sein Inhalt ist der Zweck (eidos), und dieser ist dies, durch die TÃ¤tigkeit, die Energie, gesetzt, verwirklicht zu werden. Die Momente nÃ¤her bestimmt, so ist Materie das Subjekt der VerÃ¤nderung, â€“ auch hier haben wir Materie, dynamis. Die beiden Extreme sind die Materie (MÃ¶glichkeit) und der Gedanke (Wirksamkeit), â€“ einmal das passive Allgemeine, das andere Mal das tÃ¤tige Allgemeine. In diese beiden Momente selbst fÃ¤llt die VerÃ¤nderung nicht; denn sie sind das Ansichseiende, Allgemeine als solche in entgegengesetzter Form. Â»Was verÃ¤ndert wird, ist EtwasÂ« (die Bestimmtheit) Â»und geht von einem Anderen ins AndereÂ« (in das Entgegengesetzte) Â»Ã¼ber, durch ein Anderes, von dem es bewegt wird; worinÂ« (Ort), â€“ Â»die Materie; und zu was, â€“ die IdeeÂ«,[157] Zweck, das Allgemeine. Insofern dies Allgemeine das Bewegende ist, heiÃŸt es Ursache, archÃª, insofern es aber Zweck ist, ist es der Grund, aitia (V, 1-2). â€“ Aber die Form ist die Einheit beider, besteht aus Materie oder Substrat und TÃ¤tigkeit; was Aristoteles nicht weiter erlÃ¤utere, wie sie an dieser sind, â€“ entgegengesetzt als Aufzuhebendes und zu Setzendes. Das TÃ¤tige setzt seinen Inhalt in die Wirklichkeit, der Inhalt bleibt derselbe; es ist aber noch Materie, die von der TÃ¤tigkeit verschieden ist, wenn auch beide verbunden sind. Bei der sinnlichen Substanz ist das TÃ¤tige noch ganz verschieden von der Materie. Der nous ist aber an sich fÃ¼r sich bestimmt, dieser Inhalt wird actu aber der Verstand bedarf so noch der Materie, mit der er noch nicht identisch ist, â€“ sie ist vorausgesetzt. Das, was gewÃ¶hnlich bei Aristoteles als Energie vorkommt, kommt auch als Entelechie vor. Dies ist nÃ¤her dieselbe Begriffsbestimmung der Energie, aber insofern sie freie TÃ¤tigkeit ist und den Zweck in sich selbst hat, ihn sich selbst setzt und tÃ¤tig ist, ihn sich zu setzen, â€“ Bestimmen, als Bestimmen des Zwecks, Realisieren des Zwecks. Die Seele ist wesentlich Entelechie, logos, â€“ allgemeines Bestimmen, was sich setzt, sich bewegt.

> c) Der hÃ¶chste Punkt ist aber vielmehr, wo dynamis, energeia und entelecheia vereint sind. Die absolute Substanz, das Wahrhafte, AnundfÃ¼rsichseiende, bestimmt sich hier bei Aristoteles (XII, 6, 7; vgl. IX, 8) nÃ¤her so, daÃŸ sie das Unbewegte, Unbewegliche und Ewige ist, aber das zugleich bewegend, reine TÃ¤tigkeit, actus purus ist. Dies das allgemeine Moment. Wenn es in neueren Zeiten neu geschienen hat, das absolute Wesen als reine TÃ¤tigkeit zu bestimmen, so sehen wir dies aus Unwissenheit des Aristotelischen Begriffs. Die Scholastiker haben dies mit Recht fÃ¼r die Definition Gottes angesehen: Gott ist die reine TÃ¤tigkeit, ist das, was an und fÃ¼r sich ist; er bedarf keines Materials, â€“ einen hÃ¶heren Idealismus gibt es nicht. Oder anders ausgedrÃ¼ckt: Er ist die Substanz, die in ihrer MÃ¶glichkeit auch die Wirklichkeit hat, deren Wesen (potentia) TÃ¤tigkeit selbst ist, wo beides nicht getrennt ist; an ihr ist die MÃ¶glichkeit nicht von der Form unterschieden, sie ist es, die ihren Inhalt, ihre Bestimmungen selbst, sich selbst produziert. Hier unterscheidet sich Aristoteles von Platon und polemisiert aus diesem Grunde gegen Zahl, die Idee und das Allgemeine, weil, wenn dies unbewegt, seiend an und fÃ¼r sich, Â»nicht als TÃ¤tigkeit, Wirksamkeit bestimmt wird, keine Bewegung istÂ«; es ist nicht identisch mit der reinen TÃ¤tigkeit, sondern als ruhend aufgefaÃŸt. Die ruhenden Ideen, Zahlen Platons bringen nichts zur Wirklichkeit; das Absolute ist in seiner Ruhe zugleich absolute TÃ¤tigkeit. Energie nennt er auch Entelechie; sie hat ein telos in sich, ist nicht nur formelle TÃ¤tigkeit, wo der Inhalt sonstwoher kommt. Â»Es ist mÃ¶glich, daÃŸ das, was MÃ¶glichkeit hatÂ« (dynamei ist, das Ding an sich, â€“ mit solcher leeren Abstraktion hat Aristoteles nichts zu tun), Â»nicht tÃ¤tig (wirklich) ist (energein); es hilft also nichts, die Substanzen (ousias) ewig zu machen, wie die Ideen (ta eidÃª)Â« (des Platon und die Zahlen der Pythagoreer), Â»wenn nicht ein Prinzip, das bewegen kann (metaballein, des Bestimmens), darin ist. Wenn die archÃª sich nicht bewegt, so ist sie nicht tÃ¤tig, und ihre ousia ist nur eine dynamis das, was der MÃ¶glichkeit nach ist, kann auch nicht sein. Es muÃŸ also ein Prinzip geben, dessen Substanz als TÃ¤tigkeit (Bewegung) gefaÃŸt werden muÃŸÂ«, Wirksamkeit gehÃ¶rt ihr selbst an; so ist beim Geist die Energie die Substanz selber.
Â»Diese Substanz ist ferner ohne MaterieÂ«; denn die Materie ist als solche gesetzt als das Passive, woran die VerÃ¤nderung vorgeht, das daher nicht unmittelbar (schlechthin) eins ist mit der reinen, wesentlichen TÃ¤tigkeit. Hier die Weise, wie auch sonst, ein PrÃ¤dikat nur zu verneinen, aber was seine Wahrheit, ist nicht gesagt; die Materie ist jenes Moment des unbewegten Wesens. Â»Es scheint hier aber der Zweifel zu entstehen. Denn alles TÃ¤tige scheint dynasthai, aber nicht alles MÃ¶gliche (dynamenon) zu energieren; so daÃŸ die MÃ¶glichkeit das Erste (proteron) zu sein scheintÂ«, â€“ sie ist das Allgemeine. Alles Energische hat auch MÃ¶glichkeit; aber es gibt auch MÃ¶glichkeit, die nicht energiert; so kÃ¶nnte man denken, die MÃ¶glichkeit stÃ¤nde hÃ¶her. Â»Aber wenn es so wÃ¤re, so wÃ¼rde nichts der Seienden (ouden tÃ´n ontÃ´n) sein; denn es ist mÃ¶glich, daÃŸ es zwar sein kÃ¶nnte, aber noch nicht wÃ¤re (endechetai gar dynasthai men einai, mÃªpÃ´ d' einai). Die Energie ist das HÃ¶here, FrÃ¼here (prius) als die MÃ¶glichkeit.Â« Aristoteles bemerkt in dieser RÃ¼cksicht: Â»Es ist daher nicht zu sagen, wie die Theologen sagen, daÃŸ zuerst in unendlicher Zeit ein Chaos (Kronos) oder die NachtÂ« (die Materie das erste Seiende) Â»war oder, wie die Physiker, daÃŸ alles zumal. Denn wie kÃ¶nnte etwas sein, wenn nichts der Wirklichkeit nach Ursache wÃ¤re (mÃªden estai energeia aition)? Denn die Materie bewegt nicht sich selber, sondern der Werkmeister. Leukipp und Platon sagen, die Bewegung sei immer; aber sie sagen nicht, warum (dia ti). Die reine TÃ¤tigkeit ist vor (proteron) der MÃ¶glichkeit, nicht der Zeit nach, sondern dem Wesen nachÂ«, â€“ diese ein untergeordnetes, vom Allgemeinen entferntes Moment; denn das absolute erste Wesen ist das, was in gleicher Wirksamkeit sich immer gleich bleibt. Bei jener Voraussetzung eines Chaos usf. wird eine Wirksamkeit gesetzt, die auf Anderes geht, nicht auf sich selbst, eine Voraussetzung hat; das Chaos ist nur MÃ¶glichkeit.

> Als das Wesen, das Wahrhafte, ist also zu setzen, was sich in sich selbst, also Â»im Kreise, bewegt; und dies ist nicht nur in der denkenden Vernunft zu sehen, sondern auch durch die Tat (ergÃ´)Â«, d. i. es ist vorhanden, existiert realiter in der sichtbaren Natur. Dies folgt aus der Bestimmung des absoluten Wesens als tÃ¤tigen, das in die Wirklichkeit, gegenstÃ¤ndliche Weise treten macht. Als das sich Gleiche, was sichtbar ist, ist dies absolute Wesen der ewige Himmel; die zwei Weisen der Darstellung des Absoluten sind denkende Vernunft und ewiger Himmel. Der Himmel ist aber bewegt; Â»er ist aber auch ein BewegendesÂ«. Da das Kuglige Â»Bewegendes und Bewegtes ist, so ist eine Mitte, welche bewegt, das Unbewegte ist, selbst zugleich eine Substanz und die EnergieÂ«; sie bestimmt dem Aristoteles den Kreis der in sich zurÃ¼ckkehrenden Vernunft, â€“ mit neueren Bestimmungen gleichlautend. Das Unbewegte, was bewegt, â€“ dies ist eine groÃŸe Bestimmung; das Sichselbstgleichbleibende, die Idee, bewegt und bleibt in der Beziehung auf sich selbst. Er erlÃ¤utert dies folgendermaÃŸen: Â»Sein Bewegen ist auf folgende Weise bestimmt. Dasjenige bewegt, was begehrt wird und gedacht wird; dies, was begehrt wird und gedacht wird, ist selbst unbewegtÂ«, ruhend. Es ist Zweck; dieser Inhalt oder Zweck ist aber das Begehren und Denken selbst; solcher Zweck heiÃŸt SchÃ¶nes, Gutes: Was begehrt wird, ist das, was als schÃ¶n erscheint (gefÃ¤llt), dessen Erstes oder Zweck, was mit dem Willen gewollt wird, ist, was schÃ¶n ist. Es ist als gegenstÃ¤ndliches Wesen gesetzt, was Â»wir aber begehren, weil es so erscheintÂ«, gegeben ist, Â»mehr als daÃŸ es so erscheint, weil wir es begehrenÂ«. Denn dann wÃ¤re es schlechthin durch die TÃ¤tigkeit gesetzt; es selbst ist selbstÃ¤ndig, unser Begehren wird erst erweckt. Das wahre Prinzip ist hierin aber Â»das Denken; denn der Gedanke wird nur von dem Gedachten bewegtÂ«. Der Gedanke hat Gegenstand; er ist das Unbewegte, welches bewegt. Aber dieser Inhalt ist selbst ein Gedachtes, so selbst Produkt des Gedankens; es ist unbewegt, und so ganz identisch mit der TÃ¤tigkeit des Denkens. Hier im Denken ist so diese IdentitÃ¤t vorhanden; das, welches bewegt wird und welches bewegt, ist dasselbe. Â»Dies Gedachte aberÂ« (man traut kaum seinen Augen) Â»ist die andere Reihe an und fÃ¼r sich selbst, ist sich selbst sein eigenes ElementÂ«, der als gegenstÃ¤ndlich gesetzte an und fÃ¼r sich seiende Gedanke; Â»und dieses anderen Elements Substanz ist die erste: die erste Ursache ist einfach â€“ nicht Eins â€“, und die reine TÃ¤tigkeit.Â« Die ousia dieses Gedankens ist das Denken; dieses Gedachte ise also die absolute Ursache, selbst unbewegt, aber identisch mit dem Gedanken, der von ihm bewege wird. Â»Das SchÃ¶ne und das BesteÂ« (die Pflicht, das AnundfÃ¼rsichseiende, Endzweck) Â»ist eben solchesÂ«, â€“ ein Unbewegtes, das bewegt. Â»DaÃŸ aber das Umweswillen zum Unbewegten gehÃ¶rt, zeigt der Begriff.Â« â€“ Â»Was bewegt wird, kann sich auch anders verhalten. Der Trieb (phora) Ã¼berhaupt ist die erste VerÃ¤nderung; die erste ist die Kreisbewegung, diese aber wird von jenem bewegt.Â« Jenes, der Begriff, principium cognoscendi, ist auch das Bewegende, principium essendi; er spricht es als Gott aus und zeigt die Beziehung auf das einzelne BewuÃŸtsein.


> Â»Die erste Ursache ist notwendig. Notwendig wird auf dreierlei Weisen gesagt: Î±) durch Gewalt, was gegen die Neigung (para tÃªn hormÃªn); Î²) das Zweite, ohne welches nicht das Gute; Î³) was nicht auf eine andere Weise sein kann, sondern schlechthin ist. An einem solchen Prinzip des Unbewegten ist nun der Himmel aufgehangen und die ganze NaturÂ«, das sichtbare Ewige und das sichtbare VerÃ¤nderliche. Dieses System dauert ewig und bleibt immer so. Uns als Einzelnen Â»ist nur eine kurze Zeit ein Aufenthalt, Leben, welches das vortrefflichste ist, darin vergÃ¶nnt. Jenes aber ist immer so; uns aber ist es unmÃ¶glich. Weil aber dessen TÃ¤tigkeit (energeia toutou, des Himmels) selbst auch GenuÃŸ (hÃªdonÃª) ist, so ist deswegen Wachen, Empfinden und das Denken (noÃªsis) das GenuÃŸreichsteÂ«, entgegengesetzt dem Schlafen; Hoffnungen aber und Erinnerungen sind erst GenuÃŸ um dieser willen, weil sie Energien sind. Â»Das Denken aber, das rein fÃ¼r sich selbst ist, ist ein Denken dessen, was das Vortrefflichste an und fÃ¼r sich selbst istÂ«, -absoluter Endzweck fÃ¼r sich selbst. Dieser Endzweck ist der Gedanke selbst; die Theorie ist daher das Vortrefflichste. Â»Der Gedanke (ho nous) denkt aber sich selbst durch Annahme (metalÃªpsin, Aufnahme) des Gedachten (noÃªtou)Â« als seines Gegenstandes, so ist er rezeptiv; Â»er wird aber gedacht, indem er berÃ¼hrt und denkt (noÃªtos gar ginetai thinganÃ´n kai noÃ´n), so daÃŸ der Gedanke und das Gedachte dasselbe istÂ«; der Gegenstand schlÃ¤gt um in AktivitÃ¤t, Energie.
Das Hauptmoment in der Aristotelischen Philosophie ist,[162] daÃŸ das Denken und das Gedachte eins ist, â€“ daÃŸ das Objektive und das Denken (die Energie) ein und dasselbe ist. Â»Denn das Aufnehmende des Gedachten und des Wesens ist der Gedanke.Â« Das Denken ist das Denken des Denkens. Vom Denken sagt Aristoteles: Â»Es wirkt, insofern es hatÂ« (oder: sein Besitz ist eins mit seiner Wirksamkeit), Â»so daÃŸ jenesÂ« (das Wirken, die TÃ¤tigkeit) Â»mehr gÃ¶ttlich ist als dasjenige, was die denkende Vernunft (nous) GÃ¶ttliches zu haben meintÂ« (das noÃªton). Nicht das Gedachte ist das Vortrefflichere, sondern die Energie selbst des Denkens. Die Spekulation (hÃª theÃ´ria) ist so das Erfreulichste (Seligste, hÃªdiston) und Beste (HÃ¶chste). Â»Wenn nun Gott immer so wohl daran ist als wir zuweilen (ei oun houtÃ´s eu echei, hÃ´s hÃªmeis pote, ho theos aei)Â« â€“ bei uns als einzelner Zustand, Gott ist dies ewige Denken selbst â€“, Â»so ist er bewundernswÃ¼rdig (thaumaston); wenn noch mehr, noch bewundernswÃ¼rdiger.Â« Die Menschen sind durch das Bewundern Ahnen, Anschauen, Wissen eines HÃ¶heren â€“ zur Philosophie gekommen (I, 2). Â»So ist er aber daran (echei de hÃ´de). Es ist aber auch Leben in ihm vorhanden. Denn die Wirksamkeit des Gedankens ist Leben (kai zÃ´Ãª de ge hyparchei. hÃª gar nou energeia zÃ´Ãª).Â« Besser: Denn das Leben des nous ist Wirksamkeit. Â»Er aber ist die Wirksamkeit (ekeinos de hÃª energeia); die auf sich selbstgehende Wirksamkeit ist dessen vortrefflichstes und ewiges (aidios) Leben. Wir sagen aber, daÃŸ Gott ein ewiges und das beste Leben sei. Diese ousia ist ferner keine GrÃ¶ÃŸe.Â«
Der Begriff sagt: Das Wahre ist die Einheit des Subjektiven und Objektiven und darum weder das eine noch das andere wie sowohl das eine als das andere. In diesen tiefsten spekulativen Formen hat Aristoteles sich herumgearbeitet. Das Ansich, der Gegenstand, ist nur die dynamis, das MÃ¶gliche; das Wahrhafte ist ihm diese Einheit selbst. Einheit ist schlechter Ausdruck; sie ist Abstraktion, bloÃŸer Verstand. Die Philosophie ist nicht IdentitÃ¤tssystem; das ist unphilosophisch. So ist es bei Aristoteles auch nicht trockene IdentitÃ¤t;[163] sie ist nicht das timiÃ´taton, Gott, sondern dies ist die Energie. Sie ist TÃ¤tigkeit, Bewegung, Repulsion, und so nicht tote IdentitÃ¤t; sie ist im Unterscheiden zugleich identisch mit sich. Wenn Aristoteles die strohene VerstandesidentitÃ¤t oder die Erfahrung (nihil est in intellectu, quod non fuerit in sensu) zum Prinzip gemacht hÃ¤tte, so wÃ¤re er niemals zu solcher spekulativen Idee (nous und noÃªton) gekommen. MÃ¶glichkeit und Wirklichkeit sind identisch; nous ist auch dynamis, aber nicht MÃ¶glichkeit das Allgemeinere â€“ darum HÃ¶here â€“, sondern Einzelheit, TÃ¤tigkeit. Er unterscheidet zweierlei nous den aktiven und passiven. Der nous als passiv ist nichts anderes als das Ansich, die absolute Idee als an sich betrachtet, der Vater; aber erst als TÃ¤tiges wird es gesetzt. Jedoch dies Erste, Unbewegte, als von der TÃ¤tigkeit unterschieden, als passiv, ist doch als Absolutes die TÃ¤tigkeit selbst. Dieser nous ist alles an sich; aber es ist erst Wahrheit durch die TÃ¤tigkeit.

> Das Denken ist dem Aristoteles ein Gegenstand wie die anderen, eine Art von Zustand. Er sagt nicht, es sei allein die Wahrheit, alles sei Gedanke; sondern er sagt, es ist das Erste, StÃ¤rkste, Geehrteste. DaÃŸ der Gedanke, als das zu sich selbst sich Verhaltende, sei, die Wahrheit sei, sagen wir. Ferner sagen wir, daÃŸ der Gedanke alle Wahrheit sei; nicht so Aristoteles. Ebenso haben wir in der Vorstellung Empfindung usw. als Wirkliches neben dem Denken. Wie jetzt die Philosophie spricht, drÃ¼ckt sich Aristoteles nicht aus dieselbe Ansicht liegt aber durchaus zugrunde. Eben dies ist die spekulative Philosophie des Aristoteles, alles denkend zu betrachten, in Gedanken zu verwandeln. Aristoteles denkt die GegenstÃ¤nde, und indem sie als Gedanken sind, sind sie in ihrer Wahrheit; das ist ihre ousia. Das heiÃŸt nicht, daÃŸ die GegenstÃ¤nde der Natur darum selbst denkend seien. Die GegenstÃ¤nde sind subjektiv von mir gedacht; dann ist mein Gedanke auch der Begriff der Sache, und dieser ist die Substanz der Sache. In der Natur existiert der Begriff nicht als Gedanke in dieser Freiheit, sondern hat[164] Fleisch und Blut; er hat aber eine Seele, und diese ist sein Begriff. Was die Dinge an und fÃ¼r sich sind, erkennt Aristoteles; und das ist ihre ousia. Der Begriff ist nicht fÃ¼r sich selbst, aber er ist, durch Ã„uÃŸerlichkeit verkÃ¼mmert. Die gewÃ¶hnliche Definition von Wahrheit ist: Â»Wahrheit ist Ãœbereinstimmung der Vorstellung mit dem Gegenstande.Â« Aber die Vorstellung selbst ist nur eine Vorstellung, ich bin mit meiner Vorstellung (ihrem Inhalte) noch gar nicht in Ãœbereinstimmung; ich stelle Haus, Balken vor, das bin ich noch nicht, â€“ Ich und Hausvorstellung sind ein anderes. Nur im Denken ist wahrhafte Ãœbereinstimmung des Objektiven und Subjektiven vorhanden; das bin Ich. Aristoteles findet sich also auf dem hÃ¶chsten Standpunkt; man kann nichts Tieferes erkennen wollen. Es hat nur immer selbst die Form, daÃŸ er von Vorstellungen anfÃ¤ngt, von empirischen ZustÃ¤nden des Denkens, z.B. von Schlaf, MÃ¼digkeit; davon separiert er aber dann das Denken. Aristoteles spricht nur von nous, nicht von einer besonderen Natur des nous.
Hier lÃ¶st Aristoteles (XII, 9) nun noch viele Zweifel, ob z.B. der Gedanke zusammengesetzt, ob die Wissenschaft die Sache selbst sei. Â»Es entstehen noch einige Zweifel (aporiai) wegen des nous, denn er scheint unter allem das GÃ¶ttlichste; es hat einige SchwierigkeitenÂ« (sich vorzustellen), Â»in welchen Bestimmungen oder ZustÃ¤ndenÂ« (wie er sich verhalte, daÃŸ) Â»er dies sei (pÃ´s d' echÃ´n toioutos an eiÃª. Î±) Wenn er nichts denkt, sondern sich verhÃ¤lt wie ein Schlafender, was wÃ¤re er vorzÃ¼glicher (semnon)? Wenn er aber denkt und ihn aber ein Anderes dabei beherrschte (allo kyrion), so wÃ¤re das, was seine Substanz ist, nicht ein Gedanke (noÃªsis), sondern ein VermÃ¶gen (dynamis, Kraft).Â« Alles ist Denken, immer ein Nichtruhendes; wir finden nicht auch ein Denken vor. Â»So wÃ¤re er nicht die beste (aristÃª) Substanz; denn wegen des Denkens (tou noein, actu) ist ihm seine WÃ¼rde (to timion). Î³) Ob nun der Gedanke (nous) oder das Denken (noÃªsis) seine Substanz ist, was denkt er? Sich selbst oder ein Anderes? Und[165] wenn ein Anderes, immer dasselbe oder ein Anderes? Ist nun oder nicht verschieden, das SchÃ¶ne zu denken oder das ZufÃ¤llige?Â«

> Â»Î±) Wenn der nous nicht Gedanke (noÃªsis), sondern nur VermÃ¶gen (dynamis) ist, so wÃ¼rde das fortgesetzte Denken ihm mÃ¼hevoll seinÂ«; Kraft nutzt sich ab. Î²) Alsdann, wenn der Gedanke nicht dieses Wahre wÃ¤re, so Â»wÃ¤re ein Anderes vortrefflicher als der nous, â€“ das Gedachte (nooumenon), und das Denken und der Gedanke befÃ¤nden sich in dem, der das Schlechteste denkt, â€“ daÃŸ dieses zu fliehen ist. Denn einiges nicht zu sehen, ist besser, als es zu sehen; die noÃªsis wÃ¤re also nicht das Beste. Der nous ist also dies, sich selbst zu denken, weil er das Vortrefflichste (kratiston, das MÃ¤chtigste) ist und er der Gedanke ist, der Gedanke des Gedankens (kai estin hÃª noÃªsis, noÃªseÃ´s noÃªsis). Denn Wissen und Empfindung und Meinung und Ãœberlegung scheinen immer eines anderen zu seinÂ« (einen anderen Gegenstand zu haben, oder sind ein Scheinen), Â»ihrer selbst nur im Vorbeigehen (hÃ´s en parergÃ´)Â«, zuweilen. Â»Î³) Alsdann, wenn das Denken (noein) und das Gedachtwerden (noeisthai) verschieden, welchem von beiden kommt das Gute (eu) zu? Denn es ist nicht dasselbe fÃ¼r das Denken (noÃªsei) und das Gedachte (nooumenÃ´). Oder ist bei einigen Dingen (ep' eniÃ´n) die Wissenschaft die Sache selbst (pragma)? Im Praktischen (tÃ´n praktikÃ´n) ist es die Substanz und die Bestimmtheit des Zwecks (to ti Ãªn einai), im Theoretischen der Grund (logos) und der Gedanke (noÃªsis). Da also das Gedachte und der nous nicht verschieden sind, als welche keine haben, sind sie dasselbe; und es ist nur ein Gedanke des Gedachten.Â« hylÃª Â»Noch ist ein Zweifel zurÃ¼ck, ob das Denkende nicht ein Zusammengesetztes (syntheton) sei. Denn es mÃ¶chte sich in den Teilen des Ganzen verÃ¤ndern. Das Gute (to eu, der Zweck) ist aber nicht in diesem oder jenem Teil, sondern es ist das Beste im Ganzen (en holÃ´ tini to ariston), als ein Anderes von ihm (on allo ti)Â«, dem Ganzen. Â»So verhÃ¤lt[166] sich ewig (ton hapanta aiÃ´na) das Denken seiner selbst (autÃª hautÃªs hÃª noÃªsis)Â«, wie das Beste im Universum.
Aristoteles (XII, 10) widerlegt noch einige andere Gedanken: Es kommen z.B. in Verlegenheit, die alles aus Entgegengesetzten entstehen lassen. â€“ Seine weitere Metaphysik untersucht die nÃ¤heren Bestimmungen, was Idee sei, was Prinzip usf. sei, aber es erscheint in loser Weise nacheinander, obgleich es dann zu einem ganz spekulativen Begriff vereinigt wird.

> Dieses Spekulative ist nun aber das Beste und Freiste. Diese Idee ist nun zu sehen in der Natur (als Himmel) und in der denkenden Vernunft. Aristoteles geht nun von hier zum sichtbaren Gott Ã¼ber, zum Himmel. Gott, als lebendiger Gott, ist das Universum; im Universum bricht Gott als lebendiger Gott aus. Er tritt hier als erscheinend oder als bewegend auf. Und erst in die Erscheinung fÃ¤llt der Unterschied zwischen Ursache der Bewegung und Bewegtem. Das Prinzip, Ursache, der Himmel, Â»ist selbst unbewegt, aber bewegend, â€“ in ewiger und einer BewegungÂ«; das ist der Himmel der Fixsterne. Â»Wir sehen auÃŸer der einfachen UmwÃ¤lzung (para tÃªn phoran) des Ganzen, der Bewegung der ersten unbewegten Substanz (UmwÃ¤lzung des Firmaments), noch andere ewige Bewegungen, â€“ die der PlanetenÂ« (XII, 8). Dann kommt Aristoteles auf die Planeten; auf das NÃ¤here kÃ¶nnen wir uns nicht einlassen.

> HierÃ¼ber, Ã¼ber die Organisation des Universums im allgemeinen, sagt Aristoteles (XII, 10), es sei zu untersuchen, auf welche Weise die Natur des Ganzen das Gute und das Beste an ihr habe, ob als etwas Abgesondertes und an und fÃ¼r sich selbst oder als eine Ordnung oder auf beide Weisen wie eine Armee. Â»Denn in der Ordnung besteht das Gute und der Feldherr, und er ist es in hÃ¶herem Grade (en tÃª taxei to eu kai ho stratÃªgos, kai mallon houtos); denn er ist nicht durch die Ordnung, sondern die Ordnung durch ihn.Â« Er bleibt allgemein sie, â€“ wie auch der Feldherr das Ordnende und das Geordnete ist. Â»Alles nun ist auf eine gewisse Weise (pÃ´s), aber nicht auf gleiche Weise zusammengeordnet (syntetaktai)Â« (verschiedene Arten der Organe), Â»das Schwimmende und Fliegende und die Pflanzen; und sie sind nicht so, daÃŸ keines zu dem anderen eine Beziehung hÃ¤tte, sondern sie sind ein VerhÃ¤ltnis zueinander. Denn alles ist zu Einem zusammengeordnet. Aber wie in einem Hause den Freien es am wenigsten gestattet ist, was es sei (das ZufÃ¤llige, hoti etyche) zu tun, sondern was sie tun, alles oder das meiste, (Gesetz) geordnet (vorgeschrieben, tetaktai) ist, den Sklaven und Tieren hingegen weniges, was ins allgemeine geht (mikron to eis to koinon), sondern vieles, wie es kommtÂ« (hoti etyche, WillkÃ¼r und ZufÃ¤lligkeit), so ist auch das Vortrefflichste, nach dem Allgemeinen, dem Gedanken, nous, tÃ¤tig zu sein. Â»Denn das Prinzip eines jeden ist seine Natur. Ebenso ist notwendig, daÃŸ alles in den Unterschied (Urteil) komme (ins Gericht); aber einiges ist so beschaffen, daÃŸ mit demselben alles in Gemeinschaft zum Ganzen istÂ«, gegen die Zahlen und Ideen.

> Nimmer Gedeihn bringt Vielherrschaft; nur einer sei Herrscher.

> Besondere Wissenschaften, die Aristoteles behandelt hat. Bei der Seele werden wir wieder aufs Denken zurÃ¼ckkommen. Aristoteles hat viele physikalische Werke, dann Werke Ã¼ber Seele (Geist), ZustÃ¤nde derselben. Da wird von den logischen BÃ¼chern gesprochen werden. Das bisher AngefÃ¼hrte steht in der Metaphysik (in den letzten Kapiteln des elften oder zwÃ¶lften Buchs). In der Lehre der Seele tritt das Spekulativste wieder hervor.

 {#AristotleLogic}

> Noch ist die Logik des Aristoteles zu betrachten Ã¼brig, ebensosehr jahrhunderte- und jahrtausendelang geehrt als jetzt verachtet. Obzwar die Logik hier zum erstenmale erwÃ¤hnt wird und in der ganzen folgenden Geschichte der Philosophie nie eine andere erwÃ¤hnt werden kann (denn es hat sonst keine gegeben, wenn man nicht das Negative des Skeptizismus hierher rechnen will), so kann hier doch nicht von ihrem nÃ¤heren Inhalt die Rede sein, nur eine allgemeine Charakterisierung derselben Platz finden. Er ist als der Vater der Logik angesehen worden; seit Aristoteles' Zeiten hat die Logik keine Fortschritte gemacht. Diese Formen teils Ã¼ber Begriff, teils Ã¼ber Urteil, SchluÃŸ kommen von Aristoteles her â€“ eine Lehre, welche bis auf den heutigen Tag beibehalten und keine weitere wissenschaftliche Ausbildung erlangt hat â€“, sie sind ausgesponnen und dadurch formeller geworden. Das Denken in seiner endlichen Anwendung hat Aristoteles aufgefaÃŸt und bestimmt dargestellt. Er hat sich wie ein Naturbeschreiber verhalten bei diesen Formen des Denkens, aber es sind nur die endlichen Formen bei dem SchlieÃŸen von einem auf das andere, es ist Naturgeschichte des endlichen Denkens.

> Indem sie ein BewuÃŸtsein Ã¼ber die abstrakte TÃ¤tigkeit des reinen Verstandes (nicht Wissen von diesem und jenem Konkreten), reine Form ist, so ist dies BewuÃŸtsein in der Tat bewundernswÃ¼rdig und noch bewundernswÃ¼rdiger in dieser Ausbildung dieses BewuÃŸtseins â€“ und ein Werk, das der Tiefe des Erfinders, der StÃ¤rke seiner Abstraktion die hÃ¶chste Ehre macht. Denn die hÃ¶chste StÃ¤rke des Zusammenhaltens Ã¼ber das Denken, Vorstellen ist, es vom Stoffartigen zu trennen und es festzuhalten; und fast noch mehr, wie es, mit dem Stoffe amalgamiert, sich auf die mannigfaltigste Weise umherwirft und einer Menge von Wendungen fÃ¤hig ist. Aristoteles betrachtet nicht nur die Bewegung des Denkens, sondern ebenso $[$ die Bewegung $]$ des Denkens am Vorstellen.

> Sie ist enthalten in den logischen Schriften, die unter dem Namen Organon zusammengefaÃŸt sind. Hierher gehÃ¶ren fÃ¼nf Schriften.

> a) Die Kategorien (katÃªgoriai) oder die einfachen Wesenheiten, die allgemeinen Bestimmungen, das, was von dem Seienden gesagt wird (ha tÃ´n ontÃ´n katÃªgoreitai); ebensowohl das, was wir Verstandesbegriffe nennen, als Wesenheit der Dinge. Es kann dies eine Ontologie sein, der Metaphysik angehÃ¶rig; diese Bestimmungen kommen daher auch in Aristoteles' Metaphysik vor.

> Das zweite Kapitel: Peri tÃ´n legomenÃ´n. Legein, wie aus logos erhellt, bezeichnet mehr als das bloÃŸe Sagen; und hier ist es noch dem Homonymen usw. des ersten Kapitels entgegengesetzt. Ta legomena ist Ã¼berhaupt der Ausdruck fÃ¼r bestimmte Begriffe. Â§ 1 fÃ¤ngt an tÃ´n legomenÃ´n Â§ 2 tÃ´n ontÃ´n ta men â€“ und beides wird entgegengesetzt. Aber als ta legomena rein als solche, als subjektive Beziehungen, fÃ¼hrt Aristoteles bloÃŸ an: Â»Mit Verbindung oder ohne Verbindung; der Mensch lÃ¤uft, â€“ der Mensch, LÃ¤uft.Â« Diese ontÃ´n ta men gehÃ¶ren unter das Erste der Einteilung (kata symplokÃªn) und sind allerdings Beziehungen Ã¼berhaupt, solcher, die sind, fÃ¼r sich; also ist die Beziehung nicht an ihnen selbst, sondern subjektiv oder auÃŸer ihnen. Alsdann von den ousi sagt er sogleich tÃ´n ontÃ´n ta men legetai kath' hypokeimenou tinos, und so gebraucht er weiter immer, auch von den ousi, legetai und setzt ihm das esti entgegen; so daÃŸ legetai von einer Gattung in der Beziehung auf ihr Besonderes gesetzt wird, â€“ hingegen esti von einem Allgemeinen, das nicht Idee, sondern Einfaches ist.


> Â»Â§ 2. Î±) Es gibt Bestimmtheiten (onta), welche auf ein Subjekt bezogen (von einem Subjekt ausgesagt) werden (legetai), aber in keinem Subjekte sind, wie Mensch auf[230] einen bestimmten Menschen; es ist aber nicht in einem bestimmten Menschen.Â«
Â»Î²) Andere sind in einem Subjekte, werden aber nicht so auf ein Subjekt bezogen (von einem Subjekte gesagt); (in einem Subjekte heiÃŸt: nicht als Teil in ihm sein, aber nicht sein kÃ¶nnen ohne ein Subjekt) wie eine Grammatik (tis grammatikÃª, Farbe) in einem Subjekte (der Seele) ist, aber nicht von einem Subjekte gesagtÂ« oder nicht als Gattung auf ein Subjekt bezogen werden kann.

> Â»Î³) Anderes wird bezogen auf ein Subjekt und ist in einem Subjekt; die WissenschaftÂ« (der Grammatik) Â»ist in der Seele und wird auf Grammatik bezogen.Â«
Â»Î´) Anderes ist weder in einem Subjekt noch wird es auf ein Subjekt bezogen: ein gewisser Mensch, das Einzelne, Zahlbestimmung; doch kann einiges in einem Subjekte sein, wie eine bestimmte Grammatik.Â«

> Subjekt (hypokeimenon), besser Substrat: es ist dasjenige, worauf der Begriff sich bezieht, dasjenige, was in der Abstraktion weggelassen wird, â€“ das Entgegengesetzte, worauf ein Begriff sich notwendig bezieht.
Man sieht, Aristoteles hat den Unterschied von Gattung, Allgemeinem und Einzelnem im Sinne.

> Î±) Die Gattung,legetai, von einem Menschen, ist aber nicht in ihm oder ist nicht als Einzelnes. â€“ Der tapfere Mann ist ein Wirkliches, allgemein ausgedrÃ¼ckt. In der Logik und den Begriffen ist der Gegensatz immer gegen ein Wirkliches; das logisch Wirkliche ist an sich ein Gedachtes. Die Logik sucht in ihren drei Stufen die Kategorien des Absoluten nachzuÃ¤ffen. Begriff ist logisch Wirkliches, an sich bloÃŸ Gedachtes, MÃ¶gliches. Im Urteil setzt sie einen Begriff A als ein Wirkliches (Subjekt, hypokeimenon) und verbindet ein Anderes als Begriff B damit; B soll der Begriff sein, und A in RÃ¼cksicht auf ihn ein Sein haben, â€“ aber B ist nur der allgemeinere Begriff. Im SchluÃŸ soll die Notwendigkeit nachgeahmt werden; schon in einem Urteil ist eine Synthesis eines Begriffs und seinsollenden Seins, im SchluÃŸ soll sie die[231] Form der Notwendigkeit tragen, indem beides in einem Dritten gleichgesetzt wird, im medius terminus, nach der Vernunft, die in der mesotÃªs die Entgegengesetzten gleichsetzt. Der Obersatz drÃ¼ckt logisches Sein aus; der Untersatz logische MÃ¶glichkeit (Caius ist ein bloÃŸ MÃ¶gliches fÃ¼r die Logik); der SchluÃŸsatz verbindet beides. Der tapfere Mann ist ein Gedachtes in die Form des Seins gesetzt, es ist ein Begriff als Wirkliches ausgedrÃ¼ckt; â€“ die Tapferkeit ist reine Form der Abstraktion, reines Setzen des rein Gedachten. Vor der Vernunft ist die Tugend das Lebendige; sie ist die wahre RealitÃ¤t.

> Î²) Das Allgemeine Ã¼berhaupt, das nicht Gattung ist (d.h. nicht in sich selbst die Einheit des Allgemeinen und Besonderen, â€“ oder absolute Einzelheit, Unendlichkeit), dies ist wohl in einem Subjekte Moment oder PrÃ¤dikat, aber es ist nicht fÃ¼r sich, ou legetai, es ist nicht an sich selbst; ho legetai was, als Allgemeines, fÃ¼r sich ist oder in ihm selbst zugleich unendlich.

> Î³) Das Besondere, was legetai, wie Wissenschaft in ihr selbst unendlich ist, und so die Gattung z.B. der Grammatik; und zugleich Allgemeines, oder als nicht Einzelnes, und Moment eines Subjekts ist.

> Î´) Des Aristoteles ist, was unmittelbare Vorstellung heiÃŸt: das Individuelle, Einzelne. (Die Ausnahme, daÃŸ einiges, z.B. eine bestimmte Grammatik, auch in einem Subjekte sei, gehÃ¶rt nicht hierher; denn die bestimmte Grammatik ist nicht wesentlich an ihr selbst Einzelnes.)

> Â»Â§ 3. Wenn etwas von einem Anderen prÃ¤diziert wird (katÃªgoreitai) als von einem Subjekte, so gilt, was vom PrÃ¤dikate gesagt wird (legetai)Â«, worauf es als Allgemeines bezogen ist, Â»auch vom Subjekte.Â« (Dies ist der gewÃ¶hnliche SchluÃŸ; man sieht schon hieraus, daÃŸ, indem dies so kurz abgefertigt wird, der eigentliche SchluÃŸ bei Aristoteles eine viel grÃ¶ÃŸere Bedeutung hat.)
Â»Â§ 4. Verschiedene Gattungen, die einander nicht untergeordnet sind (hyp' allÃªla tetagmena), haben verschiedene[232] spezifische Differenzen; (Â§ 5) hingegen untergeordnete kÃ¶nnen dieselben haben, denn was von den oberen gilt, gilt auch von dem SubjekteÂ« (hier heiÃŸt hypokeimenon nicht das Subjekt als solches oder wesentlich als Einzelnes Bestimmte, sondern das Untergeordnete Ã¼berhaupt).

> Â»Â§ 6. Was ohne Verbindung legetai.Â« Bisher von dem Verbundenen, wie Gattung usf. Aristoteles legte c. 2 die Einteilung in legomena aneu symplokÃªs und kata symplokÃªn zugrunde; dies bisher, â€“ jenes in der Folge, als eigentliche Kategorien, diese aneu symplokÃªs. Â»Â§ 8. Keins derselben ist eine Negation oder Affirmation, ist wahr oder falsch.Â«

> Diese Kategorien sind hier zusammengestellt; jedoch ist das Werk nicht fÃ¼r vollstÃ¤ndig anzusehen. Aristoteles nimmt ihrer zehn an: 1. Substanz, Sein (sysia); 2. QualitÃ¤t (poion); 3. QuantitÃ¤t (poson â€“ hylÃª); 4. VerhÃ¤ltnis (pros ti); 5. Ort (pou); 6. Zeit (pote); 7. Lage (keisthai); 8. Haben (echein); 9. Tun (poiein) und 10. Leiden (paschein). Diese nennt er PrÃ¤dikabilien und fÃ¼gt dann noch hinzu fÃ¼nf PostprÃ¤dikamente; er stellt sie so nebeneinander.

> Kapitel 5. Â»Vom Wesen (ousia, Substanz).Â« Â§ 1. Die Substanz, und zwar hÃª kyriÃ´tata te kai prÃ´tÃ´s kai malista legomenÃª, ist dem Aristoteles das Individuum, das Einzelne (s. c. 2, Î´); Â»alsdann (Â§ 2) die zweiten Substanzen sind, in welchen, als Arten (eidesin), jene ersten sind: sie und auch die Gattungen dieser Arten.Â«
Die Kategorien der Relation sind Synthesen der QualitÃ¤t und QuantitÃ¤t, sie gehÃ¶rten somit der Vernunft an; aber sie gehÃ¶ren dem Verstande an und sind Formen der Endlichkeit, insofern sie als Relationen gesetzt werden. Das Sein, das Wesen ist in ihnen das Erste; neben aber steht das MÃ¶gliche (Akzidenz, Bewirktes), aber getrennt. In der Substanz ist A Sein, B MÃ¶glichkeit; im KausalitÃ¤tsverhÃ¤ltnisse ist A und B Sein, aber A wird in B gesetzt als ein Setzen des A. A der[233] Substanz ist logisches Sein, es ist das Wesen entgegengesetzt seiner Existenz, und diese Existenz ist in der Logik bloÃŸe MÃ¶glichkeit. In der Kategorie der KausalitÃ¤t ist das Sein des A in B ein bloÃŸes Sein der Reflexion; B ist fÃ¼r sich selbst ein Anderes. In der Vernunft ist A ebensowohl Sein des B als des A, und A ist ganzes Sein des A, so wie des B.

> Â»Â§ 3. Von Untergeordneten wird Name und VerhÃ¤ltnis (logos, Gattung) des Allgemeinen (tÃ´n kath' hypokeimenou legomenÃ´n) prÃ¤diziert; (Â§ 4) hingegen unmÃ¶glich die Gattung des en hypokeimenÃ´ ontos von dem Subjekte (hypokeimenou, Untergeordnetem): der logos des WeiÃŸen (Farbe) nicht vom KÃ¶rper, in dem es ist.Â«
Â»Â§ 5. Das Andere aber (auÃŸer der Definition Ã¼berhaupt, und dem Namen bei einigen) wird auf die SubjekteÂ« (das Einzelne) Â»bezogen (legetai), â€“ oder ist in ihnen; ohne die ersten Substanzen (das Einzelne) kann also nichts anderes sein, â€“ (Â§ 7) weil sie allem anderen zugrunde liegen (dia to tois allois hapasi hypokeisthai).Â«
Das Genus ist nach Aristoteles weniger Substanz als die Art: Â»Â§ 6. Von den zweiten Substanzen ist die Art mehr Substanz als die Gattung; denn sie ist der ersten Substanz nÃ¤her, eigentÃ¼mlicher, â€“ (Â§ 7) und die Gattung wird von der Art, nicht umgekehrt, prÃ¤diziert; die Art ist das Subjekt. Â§ 8. Aber die Arten sind in gleichem Grade Substanzen, (Â§ 9) so wie von den prÃ´tais ousiais keine mehr Substanz ist als die andere.Â«

> Â»Â§ 10. Auch sind die Arten und Gattungen vor dem ÃœbrigenÂ« (Eigenschaften, Akzidenzen) Â»zweite Substanzen zu nennen; der Begriff Mensch vor dem, daÃŸ er weiÃŸ ist oder lÃ¤uft.Â« Abstraktion ist also zweierlei: z.B. Â»MenschÂ« und Â»gelehrtÂ«, beides sind Eigenschaften eines bestimmten Individuums; jenes abstrahiert nur von der Einzelheit und ist also Erhebung des Einzelnen zum VernÃ¼nftigen, â€“ es geht nichts verloren als die Entgegensetzung der Reflexion, nicht die TotalitÃ¤t.
Â»Â§ 12. Von den zweiten (und ersten) ousiais (Mensch und [234] zÃ´on von einem bestimmten Menschen) wird sowohl der Name als der logos von dem bestimmten Menschen gesagt, aber sie selbst sind nicht in dem bestimmten Menschen; hingegen vom Ãœbrigen, was in einem Substrat ist, kann wohl der Name vom Substrat prÃ¤diziert werden, aber nicht der logos.Â«

> Â§ 15. Was von den Substanzen gelte, gelte auch von den diaphorais, der Name sowohl als der logos sei synÃ´nymon b) Die zweite Schrift ist Ã¼ber die Interpretation; es ist die Lehre von den Urteilen und SÃ¤tzen. SÃ¤tze sind, wo Affirmation (kataphasis) und Negation (apophasis), wo pseudos und alÃªtheia stattfindet â€“ nicht in dem, wenn der nous sich selbst denkt, im reinen Denken ist; nicht Allgemeines, sondern Einzelnes.
c) Die dritte sind seine analytischen BÃ¼cher, deren zwei Werke sind, die frÃ¼heren und die spÃ¤teren; sie handeln besonders ausfÃ¼hrlich von dem Beweise und den VerstandesschlÃ¼ssen, â€“ Demonstration. Â»Der [[syllogism|syllogismos]] ist ein Grund (esti logos, BegrÃ¼nden), in welchem, wenn einiges gesetzt ist, ein Anderes als das Gesetzte nach der Notwendigkeit folgt.Â« Aristoteles' Logik hat die allgemeine Theorie der SchlÃ¼sse hauptsÃ¤chlich sehr genau behandelt; sie sind gar nicht allgemeine Form der Wahrheit. In seiner Metaphysik, Physik, Psychologie usf. hat er nicht geschlossen, sondern gedacht, den Begriff an und fÃ¼r sich.

> d) Das vierte sind die topischen BÃ¼cher (topika) oder von den Ã–rtern. Dies sind die Gesichtspunkte, die Aristoteles durchfÃ¼hrt, woraus Sache betrachtet werden kann. Cicero und Giordano Bruno haben dies nÃ¤her bearbeitet. Aristoteles gibt eine groÃŸe Anzahl von allgemeinen Gesichtspunkten an, die bei einem Gegenstande, Satze oder Aufgabe usf. genommen werden kÃ¶nnen. Jede Aufgabe kÃ¶nne sogleich auf diese verschiedenen Gesichtspunkte reduziert werden, die Ã¼berall vorkommen mÃ¼ssen. Diese Ã¶fter sind so gleichsam ein Schema von mancherlei, um danach einen Gegenstand zu betrachten, ihm nachzuforschen, â€“ eine Arbeit, die besonders fÃ¼r die Bildung von Rednern und das Schwatzen sehr zweckmÃ¤ÃŸig schien: es ist dies ein Erfordernis, Redner zu bilden, indem das BewuÃŸtsein der Gesichtspunkte die MÃ¶glichkeit an die Hand gibt, einem Gegenstande sogleich vielerlei Seiten abzugewinnen und sich nach diesen Seiten Ã¼ber ihn zu verbreiten.

> Es ist Dialektik, â€“ Ã¤uÃŸere Reflexionsbestimmungen. Aristoteles sagt, es sei ein Instrument, SÃ¤tze und SchlÃ¼sse zu finden aus Wahrscheinlichem. â€“ Solche Orte (topoi) Sind allgemein: Î±) Verschiedenheit; Î²) Ã„hnlichkeit; Î³) Gegensatz; Î´) VerhÃ¤ltnis; Îµ) Vergleichung. Â»Ã–rter, zu beweisen, daÃŸ etwas besser oder wÃ¼nschenswerter, sind: Î±) Dauer der Zeit; Î²) AutoritÃ¤t dessen oder mehrerer, die es erwÃ¤hlen; Î³) Gattung gegen die Art; Î´) wÃ¼nschenswert fÃ¼r sich; Îµ) weil es in einem Besseren ist; Î¶) Zweck; Î·) Vergleichung des Zwecks und der Folge; Ï‘) schÃ¶ner und lobens-wÃ¼rdigerÂ« usf. Aristoteles sagt, Â»man mÃ¼sse sich gegen die Dialektiker der Syllogismen, gegen die Menge der Induktion bedienenÂ«. Ebenso trennt Aristoteles die dialektischen und beweisenden Syllogismen von der rhetorischen und jeder Art der Ãœberzeugung; zu den rhetorischen rechnet Aristoteles die Induktion.

> e) Die fÃ¼nfte Schrift endlich sind die sophistischen Elenchen (sophistikoi elenchoi), oder von den Wendungen, wie der Widerspruch in der Vorstellung hervorgebracht wird, â€“ im bewuÃŸtlosen Fortlaufendes Gedankens (in den Kategorien) im Stoffartigen, worin er in bestÃ¤ndigen Widerspruch mit sich selbst gerÃ¤t. Die sophistischen Elenchen verfÃ¼hren das bewuÃŸtlose Vorstellen zu solchen WidersprÃ¼chen und machen[236] es darauf aufmerksam. Bei Zenon wurden sie erwÃ¤hnt. Besonders waren die Megariker stark darin. Aristoteles geht sie in der Art und Weise durch, daÃŸ er solche WidersprÃ¼che auflÃ¶st; er zeigt die AuflÃ¶sung dieser WidersprÃ¼che durch die Unterscheidung und Bestimmung. Er betrachtet die Elenchen, die die Sophisten und besonders die Megariker aufgesucht haben, um das bewuÃŸtlose Vorstellen zu verleiten und darin zu fangen. Aristoteles verfÃ¤hrt bei der AuflÃ¶sung dieser WidersprÃ¼che ruhig und sorgsam und lÃ¤ÃŸt sich die MÃ¼he nicht verdrieÃŸen, eine Menge durchzugehen und aufzulÃ¶sen, wenn sie auch mehr dramatischer Art sein sollten. FrÃ¼her (s. Bd. 18, S. 528 ff.) schon sahen wir Beispiele bei den Megarikern.

> Diese Teile machen zusammen sein Organon aus; was in unseren gewÃ¶hnlichen Logiken davon vorkommt, ist in der Tat das Wenigste und Trivialste, â€“ hÃ¤ufig nur die Isagoge des Porphyr. Diese Aristotelische Logik enthÃ¤lt besonders in den ersten Teilen, in der Interpretation und den analytischen BÃ¼chern, schon Darstellungen der Formen, die in der gewÃ¶hnlichen Logik abgehandelt werden, die allgemeinen Denkformen, die Grundlage dessen, was bis in die neuesten Zeiten als Logik bekannt ist.

> Î±) Es ist ein unsterbliches Verdienst des Aristoteles, dies BewuÃŸtwerden Ã¼ber die TÃ¤tigkeiten des abstrakten Verstandes, diese Formen erkannt und bestimmt zu haben, die das Denken in uns nimmt. Denn was uns sonst interessiert, ist das konkrete Denken, das Denken versenkt in Ã¤uÃŸere Anschauung: jene Formen sind darin versenkt, es ist ein Netz von unendlicher Beweglichkeit; und diesen feinen, sich durch alles hindurchziehenden Faden â€“ jene Formen â€“ zu fixieren, zum BewuÃŸtsein zu bringen, ist ein MeisterstÃ¼ck von Empirie, und dies BewuÃŸtsein ist von absolutem Wert. Das bloÃŸe Betrachten, als eine Kenntnis von den mancherlei Formen und Wendungen dieser TÃ¤tigkeit, ist schon wichtig und interessant genug. Denn so trocken und gehaltlos uns das AufzÃ¤hlen der verschiedenen Arten von Urteilen und[237] SchlÃ¼ssen und deren mannigfaltigen VerschrÃ¤nkungen erscheinen kann, auch nicht dienlich, die Wahrheit zu finden, so darf wenigstens im Gegensatz nicht andere Wissenschaft dagegen erhoben werden. Z.B. gilt es fÃ¼r wÃ¼rdige Bestrebung, die unsÃ¤gliche Menge von Tieren, Insekten, 167 Kuckucksarten, wo eine einen Busch auf dem Kopfe anders gebildet hat, eine neue elende Art von einem elenden Geschlechte eines Mooses (Moos ist Schorf), Insekts, GeschmeiÃŸes, der Wanzen (gelehrte Entomologie) kennenzulernen; es ist viel wichtiger, die mancherlei Arten der Bewegung des Denkens als jenes Ungeziefers kennenzulernen. Das Beste, was Ã¼ber die Formen des Urteils, Schlusses usf. in der gewÃ¶hnlichen Logik vorkommt, ist aus diesen Schriften des Aristoteles genommen; man hat viel im Detail daran ausgesponnen, aber das Wahrhafte findet sich schon bei Aristoteles.

> Î²) Der eigentliche philosophische Wert der Aristotelischen Logik. Diese Logik hat in unseren LehrbÃ¼chern die Stellung und Bedeutung erhalten, daÃŸ sie nur die TÃ¤tigkeit des Verstandes als BewuÃŸtsein ausdrÃ¼cke und enthalte; Anweisung, richtig zu denken, so daÃŸ es scheint, als ob die Bewegung des Denkens etwas fÃ¼r sich wÃ¤re, was das, worÃ¼ber gedacht wird, nichts anginge, â€“ Gesetze unseres Verstandes, wodurch wir zur Einsicht kommen, aber durch eine Vermittlung, Bewegung, welche nicht die Bewegung der Dinge selbst wÃ¤re. Das Resultat soll freilich Wahrheit sein, so daÃŸ die Dinge so beschaffen sind, wie wir sie nach den Gesetzen des Denkens herausbringen. Aber die Weise dieses Erkennens hat bloÃŸ eine subjektive Bedeutung; das Urteil, der SchluÃŸ ist nicht Urteil, nicht SchluÃŸ der Dinge selbst.

> Wenn nun nach dieser Ansicht das Denken fÃ¼r sich ist, so erscheint es nicht an sich als Erkennen oder hat keinen Inhalt an und fÃ¼r sich selbst, â€“ eine formelle TÃ¤tigkeit, die sich wohl richtig verlÃ¤uft, aber deren Inhalt fÃ¼r sie ein gegebener ist. Es wird zu etwas Subjektivem in diesem Sinne. An und fÃ¼r sich sind diese SchlÃ¼sse richtig, aber weil[238] ihnen der Inhalt fehlt, reicht dies Urteilen und SchlieÃŸen nicht zur Erkenntnis der Wahrheit hin. So geben die Logiker ihre Formen, und das, fÃ¼r was sie gegeben werden, wird getadelt, â€“ daÃŸ sie Formen sind. Beide Teile gestehen dies zu, daÃŸ sie richtig sind. Allein in dieser Ansicht und Tadel ist das Wahre selbst verfehlt; das Unwahre Ã¼berhaupt die Gestalt des Gegensatzes des Subjekts und Objekts und der Mangel ihrer Einheit, â€“ nicht die Frage, ob etwas an und fÃ¼r sich selbst wahr ist. So gelten die sogenannten Denkgesetze des SchlieÃŸens als wahr oder vielmehr richtig fÃ¼r sich selbst; und daran hat noch niemand gezweifelt. Das Schlimmste, was ihnen nachgesagt wird, ist, daÃŸ sie formal sind, der Fehler nur daran liege: sowohl die Gesetze des Denkens als solchen als seine Bestimmungen, die Kategorien, [sind] entweder nur Bestimmungen am Urteil oder nur subjektive Formen des Verstandes, gegen die das Ding an sich noch etwas anderes ist.

> Allein Î±) wenn sie auch nicht den empirischen Inhalt haben, so sind sie selbst der Inhalt, â€“ wahre Wissenschaft, Wissenschaft vom Denken: nichts Formales, Inhalt. Denken und seine Bewegung ist der Inhalt, â€“ ein so interessanter Inhalt, als es irgendeinen geben kann, fÃ¼r sich wahr. Allein hier tritt wieder der Nachteil der ganzen Aristotelischen Manier, und zwar im hÃ¶chsten Grade ein. Im Denken und der Bewegung des Denkens, als eines solchen, fallen in der Aristotelischen Manier und in aller folgenden Logik die einzelnen Momente auseinander; es sind eine Menge Arten des Urteilens und des SchlieÃŸens, deren jede so fÃ¼r sich gilt und an und fÃ¼r sich, als solche, Wahrheit haben soll. So sind sie eben Inhalt, gleichgÃ¼ltiges, unterschiedenes Sein: die berÃ¼hmten Gesetze des Widerspruchs usf., die SchlÃ¼sse usf.; so einzeln haben sie eben keine Wahrheit. Nur ihre TotalitÃ¤t ist die Wahrheit des Denkens; diese TotalitÃ¤t ist subjektiv und objektiv zugleich. Sie sind nur das Material der Wahrheit, der formlose Inhalt; ihr Fehler ist nicht, daÃŸ sie nur Form sind, sondern Form fehlt. So wie vielerlei Einzelnes[239] eines Dings nicht fÃ¼r sich etwas ist, rot, hart usw., sondern nur ihre Einheit ein reales Ding, so die Einheit der Formen des Urteilens und SchlieÃŸens; aber einzeln haben sie sowenig Wahrheit als eine solche Eigenschaft oder als Rhythmus, Melodie. Die Form eines Schlusses, so wie sein Inhalt, kann ganz richtig sein und doch sein SchluÃŸsatz ohne Wahrheit, weil diese Form als solche fÃ¼r sich keine Wahrheit hat. Von dieser Seite aber sind diese Formen nie betrachtet worden; und die Verachtung der Logik selbst beruht auf dem falschen Gesichtspunkt des Mangels des Inhalts. Sie haben den Fehler, zu sehr Inhalt zu sein. Î²) Dieser Inhalt ist nichts anderes als die spekulative Idee. Begriffe des Verstandes oder Vernunft sind das Wesen der Dinge, freilich nicht fÃ¼r jene Ansicht, aber in Wahrheit; auch fÃ¼r Aristoteles [sind] die Begriffe des Verstandes â€“ die Kategorien â€“ die Wesenheiten des Seins. Wenn sie also an und fÃ¼r sich wahr, so sind sie selbst ihr eigener Inhalt, und zwar sogar hÃ¶chster Inhalt; allein dies ist nicht der Fall.
Diese Formen, die in den Aristotelischen BÃ¼chern dargestellt sind, sind jedoch nur Formen des verstÃ¤ndigen Denkens; allgemeine Denkbestimmungen vereinzelt der abstrakte Verstand. Dies ist nicht die Logik des spekulativen Denkens, nicht der VernÃ¼nftigkeit als unterschieden von der VerstÃ¤ndigkeit; die VerstandesidentitÃ¤t, daÃŸ nichts sich widersprechen soll, liegt zugrunde. Solche Logik ist ihrer Natur nach nicht spekulativ. Diese Logik ist Logik des Endlichen, aber man muÃŸ sich damit bekannt machen; denn im Endlichen findet sie sich Ã¼berall. Die Mathematik z.B. ist ein fortgesetztes SchlieÃŸen; die Jurisprudenz ist das Subsumieren des Besonderen unter das Allgemeine, das ZusammenschlieÃŸen derselben. Es sind diese Formen durchgehend in den endlichen VerhÃ¤ltnissen, und es sind viele Wissenschaften, Kenntnisse usf., die keine anderen Formen des Denkens kennen, brauchen, anwenden als diese Formen des endlichen Denkens; sie machen die allgemeine Methode fÃ¼r die endlichen Wissenschaften aus. Es sind jedoch nur VerhÃ¤ltnisse[240] endlicher Bestimmungen; und der SchluÃŸ ist das Ganze, die TotalitÃ¤t dieser Bestimmungen. Der SchluÃŸ ist deswegen VernunftschluÃŸ, weil es die verstÃ¤ndige Form der VernÃ¼nftigkeit ist. Zum SchluÃŸ gehÃ¶ren drei Termini: diese Dreiheit macht die TotalitÃ¤t des Schlusses aus. Der SchluÃŸ verstÃ¤ndig gemacht, wie er in der gewÃ¶hnlichen logischen Form vorkommt, hat den Sinn, daÃŸ ein Inhalt zusammengeschlossen wird mit einem anderen. Der vernÃ¼nftige SchluÃŸ dagegen hat den Inhalt, daÃŸ das Subjekt usf. sich mit sich selbst zusammenschlieÃŸt; der VernunftschluÃŸ ist, daÃŸ irgendein Inhalt, Gott usf., durch Unterscheiden von sich sich mit sich selbst zusammenschlieÃŸt. Diese IdentitÃ¤t macht das wesentliche Moment des spekulativen Gehalts, der Natur des vernÃ¼nftigen Schlusses aus. Aristoteles ist so der Urheber der verstÃ¤ndigen, gewÃ¶hnlichen Logik; seine Formen betreffen nur das VerhÃ¤ltnis von Endlichem zueinander; das Wahre kann in solchen Formen nicht gefaÃŸt werden. Aber zu bemerken ist, daÃŸ hierauf nicht seine Logik gegrÃ¼ndet ist, daÃŸ diese nicht sich auf dies verstÃ¤ndige VerhÃ¤ltnis begrÃ¼ndet, daÃŸ es nicht diese Formen des Schlusses sind, nach denen Aristoteles verfÃ¤hrt. Wenn Aristoteles so verfÃ¼hre, so wÃ¼rde er nicht dieser spekulative Philosoph sein, als den wir ihn erkannt haben; keiner seiner SÃ¤tze, seiner Ideen kÃ¶nnte aufgestellt, behauptet werden, kÃ¶nnte gelten, wenn er sich an die Formen dieser gewÃ¶hnlichen Logik hielte. Man muÃŸ ja nicht glauben, daÃŸ Aristoteles, indem er spekulativ ist, nach dieser seiner Logik, nach diesen Formen im Organon gedacht, fortgeschritten, bewiesen hÃ¤tte; sonst hÃ¤tte er keinen Schritt forttun kÃ¶nnen, da wÃ¤re er zu keinem spekulativen Satz gekommen.
Wie die ganze Aristotelische Philosophie, so bedarf seine Logik (gleichsam Naturgeschichte der geistigen Formen, wie dort Tier, Einhorn, Mammut â€“ was solch eine Bestie â€“, KÃ¤ferart, Molluske betrachtet wird) wesentlich dieser Umschmelzung, daÃŸ die Reihe seiner Bestimmungen in ein notwendiges systematisches Ganzes gebracht wird, â€“ nicht ein[241] systematisches Ganzes, daÃŸ richtig eingeteilt und kein Teil vergessen werde und sie auch in ihrer richtigen Ordnung vorgestellt werden, sondern daÃŸ es ein lebendiges organisches Ganzes wird, worin jeder Teil als Teil gilt und nur das Ganze als solches Wahrheit hat. Aristoteles, wie z.B. in der Politik, drÃ¼ckt oft diese Wahrheit aus. Eben darum hat auch die einzelne logische Form keine Wahrheit an ihr selbst; nicht darum, weil sie Form oder Denken ist, sondern weil sie bestimmte Form, bestimmtes Denken ist, einzelne Form, und darin gelten soll. Aber als System, absolute Form, die diesen Inhalt beherrscht, so hat das Denken seinen Inhalt an ihm selbst, Unterschied: ist spekulative Philosophie, Inhalt, der unmittelbar Subjekt und Objekt ist, â€“ Begriff und Allgemeines sind Wesenheiten der Dinge. Sie gelten als Formen, denen der Inhalt gegenÃ¼bersteht, weil sie selbst nicht die Gestalt des Inhalts haben. Wie die Pflicht eben das AnundfÃ¼rsichsein ausdrÃ¼ckt, so das Denken das Ansichsein; aber ein bestimmtes AnundfÃ¼rsichsein, bestimmtes Ansichsein ist selbst nur Moment: muÃŸ sich bestimmen, aber sein Bestimmen auch wieder aufzuheben wissen. Die logische Form, die sich als diese bestimmte aufhebt, gibt eben darin ihren Anspruch, daÃŸ sie an und fÃ¼r sich gelte, auf. Dann ist die Logik Wissenschaft der Vernunft; sie ist spekulative Philosophie der reinen Idee des absoluten Wesens, nicht Gegensatz des Subjekts und Objekts, sondern bleibt Gegensatz im Denken selbst. Vielerlei ist gleichgÃ¼ltige Form.

> In dieser Darlegung des Hauptinhalts der Aristotelischen Philosophie bin ich weitlÃ¤ufiger gewesen, teils der Wichtigkeit der Sache selbst (es ist eigener Inhalt) [wegen], teils weil in der Tat an keiner Philosophie sich die neuere Zeit so vergangen hat als an ihr und keinem der alten Philosophen so viel abzubitten ist als Aristoteles. Aristoteles ist, wenn einer, fÃ¼r einen der Lehrer des Menschengeschlechts anzusehen; sein Begriff ist in alle SphÃ¤ren des BewuÃŸtseins eingedrungen, und diese Vereinzelung in der Bestimmung durch den Begriff, da sie gleichfalls notwendig ist, enthÃ¤lt in jeder[242] SphÃ¤re die tiefsten richtigen Gedanken. Aristoteles â€“ um die Ã¤uÃŸere Geschichte seiner Philosophie im allgemeinen hier zu antizipieren â€“ ist daher viele Jahrhunderte lang ununterbrochen der TrÃ¤ger der Bildung des Denkens gewesen. Als im christlichen Abendlande unter den Christen die Wissenschaft verschwand, hat unter den Arabern sein Ansehen ebensosehr geglÃ¤nzt, von welchen seine Philosophie in spÃ¤teren Zeiten wieder dem Abendlande Ã¼berliefert worden ist. Der Triumph, der gefeiert worden ist, daÃŸ die Aristotelische Philosophie aus den Schulen, aus den Wissenschaften, besonders aus der Theologie (Philosophie Ã¼ber das absolute Wesen) verdrÃ¤ngt worden, hat die doppelte Seite: einmal daÃŸ in der Tat nicht die Aristotelische Philosophie sosehr verdrÃ¤ngt worden, als das Prinzip dieser, besonders der theologischen Wissenschaft, das Prinzip, daÃŸ die erste Wahrheit eine gegebene, geoffenbarte ist, â€“ eine Voraussetzung, die ein fÃ¼r allemal zugrunde liegt und an der sich die Vernunft und das Denken nur oberflÃ¤chlich hin und her zu bewegen das Recht und die Kraft habe. In dieser Gestalt hatte das im Mittelalter erwachende Denken sich die Theologie besonders zurechtgemacht, sich in alle dialektische Bewegungen und Bestimmungen eingelassen und ein GebÃ¤ude errichtet, wo der gegebene Stoff nur oberflÃ¤chlich verarbeitet, verteilt, bewahrt wurde. Der Triumph Ã¼ber dieses System war der Triumph Ã¼ber dieses Prinzip und der Triumph des selbsttÃ¤tigen freien Denkens. Eine andere Seite aber dieses Triumphs ist der Triumph der Gemeinheit die sich vom Begriffe befreite und das Joch des Gedankens abschÃ¼ttelte. Ehemals und noch jetzt hÃ¶rte man genug von Aristoteles' scholastischen Spitzfindigkeiten; mit diesen Namen glaubt man ein Recht zu haben, die Abstraktion sich zu ersparen â€“ und statt des Begriffs sich zum Sehen, HÃ¶ren und so Fortlaufen an dem, was gesunder Menschenverstand heiÃŸt, berechtigt. Auch in der Wissenschaft ist an die Stelle von spitzfindigen Gedanken spitzfindiges Sehen getreten; ein KÃ¤fer, Vogelarten werden so spitzfindig unterschieden[243] als sonst Begriffe und Gedanken. Ob eine Vogelart rote oder grÃ¼ne Farbe, einen mehr so geformten Schwanz hat usf., â€“ solche Spitzfindigkeiten finden sich leichter als die Unterschiede des Gedankens; und einstweilen, bis ein Volk sich heraufgebildet an Arbeit des Denkens, Allgemeines aushalten zu kÃ¶nnen, ist jenes eine nÃ¼tzliche Vorbereitung, oder es ist vielmehr ein Moment in diesem Wege der Bildung.

> Der Mangel der Aristotelischen Philosophie liegt also darin, daÃŸ, nachdem durch sie die Vielheit der Erscheinungen in den Begriff erhoben war, dieser aber in eine Reihe bestimmter Begriffe auseinanderfiel, die Einheit, der absolut sie vereinende Begriff nicht geltend gemacht worden. Dies ist es nun, was die Folgezeit zu leisten hatte. Dies erscheint nun so: das BedÃ¼rfnis ist Einheit des Begriffs. Diese Einheit ist das absolute Wesen. Sie stellt sich zuerst als Einheit des SelbstbewuÃŸtseins und BewuÃŸtseins dar, reines Denken. Die Einheit des Wesens als Wesens ist gegenstÃ¤ndliche Einheit, der Gedanke, das gedacht ist. Aber die Einheit als Begriff, die an sich allgemeine negative Einheit, die Zeit als absolut erfÃ¼llte Zeit und in ihrer ErfÃ¼llung als Einheit ist das reine SelbstbewuÃŸtsein. Dies sehen wir deswegen so eintreten, daÃŸ das reine SelbstbewuÃŸtsein sich zum Wesen macht; aber zugleich zuerst mit der subjektiven Bedeutung als ein SelbstbewuÃŸtsein, das so als dieses fixiert ist und sich von dem gegenstÃ¤ndlichen Wesen trennt und daher mit einer Differenz zunÃ¤chst behaftet ist, die es nicht Ã¼berwindet.
Diese Notwendigkeit der Sache hat die stoische, epikureische, dann die neuakademische, skeptische Philosophie herbeigefÃ¼hrt, die nun zu betrachten sind.

> Der unmittelbare Nachfolger des Aristoteles war Theophrast, geboren Ol. 102, 2 (371 v. Chr.), berÃ¼hmt, doch nur ein Kommentator des Aristoteles (Aristoteles ist ein so[244] reicher Schatz von philosophischen Begriffen, daÃŸ sich viel Stoff darin findet zu weiterer Bearbeitung, abstrakterer Darstellung und Heraushebung einzelner SÃ¤tze); aber von ihm, so wie von vielen anderen, z.B. Dikaiarch aus Messina, unter denen Straton aus Lampsakos, der Nachfolger des Theophrast, der berÃ¼hmteste ist, ist nicht viel zu berichten, â€“ von letzterem nur wenige allgemeine Nachrichten darÃ¼ber: daÃŸ er als Physiker sich berÃ¼hmt gemacht und sein Begriff der Natur dem mechanischen Weg, jedoch nicht dem mechanischen des Leukipp und Demokrit und dann Epikurs, sondern aus WÃ¤rme und KÃ¤lte folgte und (wenn es so bestimmt wahr ist, was von ihm berichtet wird), den Gedanken des Aristoteles sehr ungetreu geworden, alles auf Mechanismus und Zufall zurÃ¼ckfÃ¼hrte, teleologischen Zweck entfernte, â€“ nicht den schlechten moderner Zeit. Die Ã¼brigen Peripatetiker beschÃ¤ftigen sich mehr mit Ausbildung einzelner Lehren des Aristoteles, mit einer AusfÃ¼hrung seiner Werke, in gleichem Inhalte, â€“ nur eine mehr oder weniger rhetorische, kommentatorische Form. Es ist schon erinnert worden, daÃŸ die Aristotelischen Schriften frÃ¼h verschwanden und die Aristotelische Philosophie nicht sowohl durch diese Urkunden sich erhielt als durch die Tradition in der Schule, wodurch sie also wesentliche VerÃ¤nderungen bald erlitt und AusfÃ¼hrungen der Aristotelischen Lehre veranlaÃŸte, von denen man nicht weiÃŸ, ob nicht einige sich eingeschlichen unter das, was fÃ¼r seine Werke gilt.
Die peripatetische Schule setzte als Prinzip der GlÃ¼ckseligkeit, Tugend: logos und Neigung.

> Hiermit wollen wir es in Ansehung der Aristotelischen Philosophie bewenden lassen. Es ist schwer davon loszukommen; je mehr man in das Detail geht, je interessanter wird es und je mehr findet man das Zusammenhalten der GegenstÃ¤nde. Die Aristotelische Philosophie hat auch den Namen peripatetische Philosophie erhalten; und diese ist mehr, z.B. zu Ciceros Zeiten, eine Art von PopulÃ¤rphilosophie geworden, als daÃŸ die tiefe, spekulative Weise des Aristoteles ausgebildet und zum BewuÃŸtsein gekommen wÃ¤re.

> Aristoteles ist der wÃ¼rdigste unter den Alten, studiert zu werden.

> Wir haben die erste Abteilung der griechischen Philosophie geschlossen und zur zweiten Periode Ã¼berzugehen. Die erste Periode der griechischen Philosophie ging bis zu Aristoteles, bis zu dieser Gestaltung der Wissenschaft. Das Resultat bei Platon und Aristoteles war die Idee; das Erkennen hat diesen Boden des Denkens, als freien, gewonnen. Bei Platon hatten wir das Allgemeine mehr abstrakterweise als Prinzip; der Boden ist aufgefaÃŸt worden. Bei Aristoteles ist das Denken konkret geworden; es ist nicht die unbewegte abstrakte Idee, sondern sie als konkret in der Wirksamkeit. Das nÃ¤chste BedÃ¼rfnis, was nun unmittelbar notwendig ist, muÃŸ hervorgehen, enthalten sein in dem, wozu sich die Philosophie unter Platon und Aristoteles ausgebildet hatte. Dies BedÃ¼rfnis ist nichts anderes, als daÃŸ das Allgemeine jetzt gefaÃŸt wird als ein Allgemeines, als die Allgemeinheit des Prinzips, daÃŸ auf eine allgemeine Weise ein Prinzip herausgehoben oder geltend gemacht wird, so daÃŸ das Besondere durch dieses Allgemeine erkannt werde; oder es tritt unmittelbar das BedÃ¼rfnis einer systematischen Philosophie ein. Man kann von platonischem und aristotelischem Systeme sprechen, sie sind aber nicht in der Form des Systems; dazu gehÃ¶rt, daÃŸ ein Prinzip aufgestellt und konsequent durchs Besondere hindurchgefÃ¼hrt wird. Die Aristotelische Philosophie ist vollstÃ¤ndiger Komplex des Begreifens des Universums, bei Aristoteles haben wir alles aufs Spekulative zurÃ¼ckgefÃ¼hrt, hÃ¶chste Weise der Wissenschaft, gesehen; aber[246] er ist empirisch zu Werke gegangen. Bei Aristoteles ist wohl ein Prinzip und spekulatives, aber nicht als eines herausgehoben; die Natur des Spekulativen ist nicht als der Begriff fÃ¼r sich zum BewuÃŸtsein gebracht worden, nicht die Entwicklung der Mannigfaltigkeit des natÃ¼rlichen und geistigen Universums in sich enthaltend, â€“ noch weniger ist es als das Allgemeine aufgestellt, aus welchem das Besondere entwickelt wÃ¼rde (seine Logik ist vielmehr das Gegenteil). Aristoteles geht mehr die Reihe der Lebendigen und der Toten durch, lÃ¤ÃŸt sie vor sein objektives, nÃ¤mlich begreifendes Denken treten und erfaÃŸt sie begreifend. Jeder Gegenstand ist fÃ¼r sich Begriff; er sagt: dies ist der Gegenstand, wir finden ihn in diesen Bestimmungen. Diese Gedanken bringt er aber zusammen; und dadurch ist er dann spekulativ. Aristoteles und Platon sind im Ganzen zugleich empirisch verfahren, haben diese und diese Vorstellung aufgenommen und sind sie durchgegangen; besonders tritt diese lose Manier bei Aristoteles hervor. In der Aristotelischen Wissenschaft ist die Idee des sich selbst denkenden Denkens als die hÃ¶chste Wahrheit aufgefaÃŸt; aber die Realisierung desselben, das BewuÃŸtsein des natÃ¼rlichen und geistigen Universums, macht auÃŸerhalb jener Idee eine lange auÃŸereinanderfallende Reihe besonderer Begriffe aus. Was mangelt, ist ein Prinzip, das durchs Besondere hindurchgefÃ¼hrt wird. Der Umfang des Erkannten muÃŸ auch als eine Einheit, eine Organisation des Begriffs erscheinen. Das nÃ¤chste BedÃ¼rfnis der Philosophie ist daher jetzt, daÃŸ das Allgemeine frei fÃ¼r sich aufgefaÃŸt werde, das BedÃ¼rfnis eines Prinzips fÃ¼r alle Besonderheit, â€“ jene Idee so aufzufassen, daÃŸ die vielgestaltete RealitÃ¤t auf sie als das Allgemeine bezogen, dadurch bestimmt und in dieser Einheit erkannt werde. Und dies ist der Standpunkt, den wir in dieser zweiten Periode haben.

> Solche systematische Philosophie wird zunÃ¤chst zum Dogmatismus, und daher tritt ihm gleich der Skeptizismus gegenÃ¼ber; Dogmatisch nennen die Franzosen systematique (systÃ¨me: ein Prinzip konsequent durchgefÃ¼hrt, die Vorstellungen[247] mÃ¼ssen aus einer Bestimmung flieÃŸen); daher ist systematique gleichbedeutend mit einseitig. Wir sahen bei Aristoteles die hÃ¶chste Idee, das sich selbstdenkende Denken; dieses steht wieder nur als Besonderes an seinem Orte, es ist nicht Prinzip seiner ganzen Philosophie. Dieses sich selbstdenkende Denken ist vollkommen konkret: sich selbst denken ist objektiv, das Denken ist subjektiv, â€“ nous, der objektiv und subjektiv ist, BewuÃŸtsein der Einheit; es ist, als Denken des Denkens, so konkret. Das weitere wÃ¤re, Î±) diese Idee aus sich zu entwickeln und das Allgemeine so als real Allgemeines vorzustellen, â€“ die Welt zu erkennen, so daÃŸ der Inhalt nur als Bestimmung des sich selbst denkenden Denkens gefaÃŸt werde. Dieses hat an und fÃ¼r sich nicht geschehen kÃ¶nnen. Es wird nur die Notwendigkeit eines Prinzips erkannt. Î²) Das zweite ist, daÃŸ dieses Prinzip formell, abstrakt dasteht und das Besondere noch aus ihm nicht deduziert wird, sondern das Allgemeine nur aufs Besondere angewendet wird und die Regel der Anwendung gesucht wird. Das Besondere mÃ¼ÃŸte aus der Idee entwickelt werden, so wÃ¤re sie konkret; bei Aristoteles ist sie an sich konkret. Das andere VerhÃ¤ltnis wÃ¤re nur Subsumtion des Besonderen unters Allgemeine; so sind beide voneinander unterschieden, die Vereinigung ist nur Vereinigung der Subsumtion, das Allgemeine ist darum nur formelles Prinzip. Die Erscheinungen der physischen und geistigen Welt mÃ¼ssen von ihrer Seite herauf erst dem Begriffe zu- und vorgearbeitet sein (Gesetze), â€“ daÃŸ beide GeschÃ¤fte sich begegnen. Die anderen Wissenschaften fÃ¼r sich erheben die Erscheinung in den bestimmten Gedanken, â€“ BedÃ¼rfnis, ganz allgemeine, aber bestimmte GrundsÃ¤tze zu formieren; dann kann die spekulative Vernunft sich in ihm und den Zusammenhang derselben, der innerlich ist, vollends darstellen.
Es muÃŸ also allgemeines Prinzip hervortreten, das Besondere wird aber nicht daraus entwickelt; so ist das Prinzip abstrakt, und dadurch wird solche Philosophie einseitig. Denn nur das in sich Konkrete, was beide Seiten in sich hat,[248] ist nicht einseitig. Darin sind solche Philosophien nÃ¤her dogmatisch, behauptend. Denn bei dieser Weise wird das Prinzip behauptet, nicht auf die wahrhafte Weise bewiesen. Denn es wird ein Prinzip gefordert, worunter alles subsumiert werde; es ist nur das Erste, so ist es nicht bewiesen, nur behauptet.

> Dieses BedÃ¼rfnis fÃ¼r das Erkennen ist vorhanden. Das diesem BedÃ¼rfnis Entsprechende erscheint jetzt in der Welt durch die innere Notwendigkeit des Geistes, â€“ nicht Ã¤uÃŸerlich, sondern wie es dem Begriffe gemÃ¤ÃŸ ist. Dies BedÃ¼rfnis hat die stoische, epikureische und skeptische Philosophie erzeugt.
Wenn wir uns in dieser ersten Periode aufgehalten haben, so kÃ¶nnen wir dies nun nachholen; denn in der nÃ¤chsten Periode kÃ¶nnen wir kurz sein.

> {#DescartesDerAnfaenger} RenÃ© Descartes ist in der Tat der wahrhafte AnfÃ¤nger der modernen Philosophie, insofern sie das Denken zum Prinzip macht. Das Denken fÃ¼r sich ist hier von der philosophierenden Theologie verschieden, die es auf die andere Seite stellt; es ist ein neuer Boden. Die Wirkung dieses Menschen auf sein Zeitalter und die neue Zeit kann nicht ausgebreitet genug vorgestellt werden. Er ist so ein Heros, der die Sache wieder einmal ganz von vorne angefangen und den Boden der Philosophie erst von neuem konstituiert hat, auf den sie nun erst nach dem Verlauf von tausend Jahren zurÃ¼ck gekehrt ist. Die groÃŸe Wirkung, die Cartesius auf sein Zeit alter und die Bildung der Philosophie Ã¼berhaupt gehabt hat, liegt vornehmlich darin, auf eine freie und einfache, zugleich populÃ¤re Weise mit Hintansetzung aller Voraussetzung von dem populÃ¤ren Gedanken selbst und ganz einfachen SÃ¤tzen angefangen und den Inhalt auf Gedanken und Ausdehnung oder Sein gefÃ¼hrt, dem Gedanken gleichsam diesen seinen Gegensatz hingestellt zu haben. Mit Hintansetzung aller Voraussetzung hat er vom Denken angefangen, und zwar in Form des bestimmten, klaren Verstandes; dieses Denken kann man nicht spekulatives Denken, spekulative Vernunft nennen. Es sind feste Bestimmungen, aber nur des Gedankens, von denen er anfÃ¤ngt und fortgeht; dieses ist die Weise seiner Zeit. Was die Franzosen exakte Wissenschaften nannten, Wissenschaften des bestimmten Verstandes, haben mit dieser Zeit angefangen. Philosophie und exakte Wissenschaft ist nicht getrennt gewesen; erst spÃ¤ter trat Trennung beider ein.

> Sein Leben: Er ist 1596 geboren zu La Haye in Touraine aus einem alt-adligen Geschlecht. Er genoÃŸ die gewÃ¶hnliche Erziehung in einer Jesuitenschule; er machte groÃŸe Fortschritte, war von einem lebhaften, unruhigen Geist, griff mit einem unersÃ¤ttlichen Eifer nach allen Seiten hin und trieb sich in allen Systemen und Formen herum, studierte auÃŸer der alten Literatur besonders Philosophie, Mathematik, Chemie, Physik, Astronomie usf. Aber seine Jugendstudien in der Jesuitenschule und sein ferner fortgesetztes Studium hatten, nachdem er sich mit Anstrengung in ihnen herumgetrieben hatte, ihm eine starke Abneigung gegen das Studium aus BÃ¼chern gegeben; er verlieÃŸ diese Anstalt. Er wurde verwirrt, erhielt unbefriedigte Sehnsucht; aber sein Eifer zur Wissenschaft wurde nur desto reger gemacht.
Er ging als ein junger Mann, 18 Jahre alt, nach Paris und lebte dann in der groÃŸen Welt. Als er aber auch hier keine Befriedigung fand, verlieÃŸ er bald die Gesellschaft und kehrte zu den Studien zurÃ¼ck. Er retirierte sich incognito in eine Vorstadt von Paris und lebte da entfernt im Studium der Mathematik insbesondere, allen seinen vorigen Bekannten ganz verborgen, bis er nach zwei Jahren endlich von seinen alten Freunden hier entdeckt, hervorgezogen und wieder in die groÃŸe Welt eingefÃ¼hrt wurde. â€“ Er entsagte jetzt wieder ganz dem BÃ¼cherstudium und warf sich in die Welt, in die Wirklichkeit. Er ging hierauf nach Holland und[124] nahm MilitÃ¤rdienste; und bald nachher 1619, in dem ersten Jahre des DreiÃŸigjÃ¤hrigen Krieges, nahm er als Freiwilliger unter den bayrischen Truppen Kriegsdienste und machte mehrere FeldzÃ¼ge unter Tilly mit. (Manchen haben die Wissenschaften nicht befriedigt, und er ist Soldat geworden, â€“ aber nicht, weil ihm die Wissenschaften zuwenig, sondern weil sie ihm zuviel, zu hoch waren.) Hier in den Winterquartieren studierte er fleiÃŸig und machte z.B. in Ulm Bekanntschaft mit einem BÃ¼rger, der sehr in die Mathematik eingeweiht war. Dies war noch mehr in den Winterquartieren zu Neuburg an der Donau der Fall, wo in ihm abermals erst recht tief der Trieb erwachte, sich eine neue Bahn in der Philosophie zu machen, die Philosophie umzuschaffen; er gelobte der Mutter Gottes eine Wallfahrt nach Loretto, wenn sie ihm dies Vorhaben gelingen lassen wÃ¼rde, wenn er ruhig nun endlich zu sich selbst kÃ¤me. â€“ So war er auch in der Schlacht bei Prag, worin Friedrich von der Pfalz die bÃ¶hmische Krone verlor. Noch weniger konnte ihn der Anblick dieser wilden Szenen befriedigen; 1621 verlieÃŸ er die Kriegsdienste und machte noch mehrere Reisen durch das Ã¼brige Deutschland, dann Polen, PreuÃŸen, die Schweiz, Italien, Frankreich.
Er zog sich dann wegen der grÃ¶ÃŸeren Freiheit nach Holland zurÃ¼ck, um hier sein Vorhaben auszufÃ¼hren; er lebte hier in Ruhe von 1629 bis 1644, â€“ eine Periode, worin er seine meisten Schriften schrieb und herausgab und sie auch gegen die mannigfaltigen Angriffe verteidigte, die sie besonders von der Geistlichkeit erlitten. Die KÃ¶nigin Christine von Schweden berief ihn endlich an ihren Hof nach Stockholm, das der Sammelplatz der berÃ¼hmtesten Gelehrten der damaligen Zeit war; und dort starb er 1650.

> Descartes hat der Mathematik ebenso ein neues Emporstreben gegeben als der Philosophie. Mehrere Hauptmethoden sind seine Entdeckungen, worauf nachher die glÃ¤nzendsten Resultate der hÃ¶heren Mathematik gebaut worden sind. Seine Methode macht noch heute eine wesentliche Grundlage der Mathematik aus; Cartesius ist der Erfinder der analytischen Geometrie und somit derjenige, der auch hierin der modernen Mathematik ihre Bahn angewiesen hat. Auch hat er Physik, Optik, Astronomie kultiviert und darin die grÃ¶ÃŸten Entdeckungen gemacht. Doch diese Seite gehÃ¶rt nicht hierher.

> 1. In der Philosophie hat er eine ganz neue Wendung genommen: mit Descartes beginnt die neue Epoche der Philosophie, wodurch der Bildung das Prinzip ihres hÃ¶heren Geistes in Gedanken zu fassen, in der Form der Allgemeinheit, vergÃ¶nnt war, wie BÃ¶hme es in Anschauungen, sinnlichen Formen faÃŸte. Unter seinen philosophischen Schriften haben besonders diejenigen, welche die Grundlage enthalten, in ihrer Darstellung etwas sehr PopulÃ¤res und Naives, was sie beim Beginne des Studiums sehr empfehlenswert macht; er geht ganz einfach und kindlich dabei zu Werke, â€“ es ist ErzÃ¤hlen seiner Gedanken nacheinander. Er ging davon aus, jede Voraussetzung mÃ¼sse hintangesetzt werden, der Gedanke mÃ¼sse von sich selbst anfangen; alles bisherige Philosophieren, besonders das von der AutoritÃ¤t der Kirche ausging, wurde hintangestellt. Da das Denken hier sich aber eigentlich nur als abstrakter Verstand gefaÃŸt hat, so wurden die bestimmten Vorstellungen, der Inhalt, nicht aus dem Verstande abgeleitet, sondern empirischerweise aufgenommen. â€“ Bei seiner Philosophie ist zu unterscheiden, was allgemeines Interesse fÃ¼r uns hat und was nicht. Die Anwendung der Metaphysik auf kirchliche Angelegenheiten, Untersuchungen usf. hat kein Interesse. Auch in seiner Philosophie ist zu unterscheiden der Gang seiner Gedanken selbst und dann die Weise, wie er diese Gedanken abgeleitet, bewiesen hat. Um seinen Gedanken Gerechtigkeit widerfahren zu lassen, ist es nÃ¶tig, daÃŸ wir fÃ¼r uns bekannt, vertraut sind mit der Notwendigkeit dieser Erscheinung. Was nun die Methode anbetrifft, wie er die Gedanken gestellt, wie er sie abgeleitet hat, so hat dies kein besonderes Interesse fÃ¼r uns. â€“ Es ist im ganzen wenig von seiner Philosophie zu sagen.

> a) Er hat von vorn angefangen, vom Denken als solchen; und dies ist ein absoluter Anfang. Und daÃŸ nur vom Denken angefangen werden mÃ¼sse, drÃ¼ckt er so aus, daÃŸ man an allem zweifeln mÃ¼sse. Zum ersten Erfordernis der Philosophie macht Descartes, daÃŸ man an allem zweifeln, d.h. alle Voraussetzungen aufgeben mÃ¼sse. De omnibus dubitandum est, war der erste Satz des Cartesius, â€“ dies Versenken aller Voraussetzungen und Bestimmungen selbst. Es hat jedoch nicht den Sinn des Skeptizismus, der sich kein anderes Ziel setzt als das Zweifeln selbst, daÃŸ man stehenbleiben soll bei dieser Unentschiedenheit des Geistes, der darin seine Freiheit hat, sondern es hat vielmehr den Sinn, man mÃ¼sse jedem Vorurteil entsagen â€“ d.h. allen Voraussetzungen, die ebenso unmittelbar als wahr angenommen â€“ und vom Denken anfangen, um erst vom Denken aus auf etwas Festes zu kommen, einen reinen Anfang zu gewinnen. Dies ist bei den Skeptikern nicht der Fall; da ist der Zweifel das Resultat. Descartes' Zweifeln, keine Voraussetzung Machen, weil nichts Festes, Sicheres ist, geschieht nicht im Interesse der Freiheit selbst als solcher, daÃŸ nichts gelte auÃŸerhalb der Freiheit, nichts sei in QualitÃ¤t, Weise einer Voraussetzung, eines Ã¤uÃŸerlich Objektiven. Unfest ist alles, insofern ich davon abstrahieren kann, d. i. denken; eben reines Denken ist Abstrahieren von allem. Der Trieb der Freiheit liegt in der Tat zugrunde, aber Ã¼berwiegend oder im BewuÃŸtsein ist der Zweck, zu etwas Festem, Objektivem zu kommen, â€“ das Moment des Objektiven, nicht das Moment des Subjektiven, daÃŸ es von mir gesetzt, erkannt, erwiesen sei; aber dies Interesse fÃ¤llt darein, denn von meinem Denken aus will ich dahin kommen. Wir mÃ¼ssen nicht den Gang des Descartes fÃ¼r konsequent der Methode nach bewiesen halten; es ist tiefer, innerer Fortgang, naiv erscheinend. Der Geist seiner Philosophie ist Wissen, Gedanken, Einheit des Denkens und Seins.

> Das Erste ist also, man mÃ¼sse keine Voraussetzung machen; und dies ist ein groÃŸes, hÃ¶chst wichtiges Prinzip. Descartes gibt in seiner Weise den Grund davon an; in diesen SÃ¤tzen, die er ausspricht, hat er naives, empirisches RÃ¤sonnement. NÃ¤mlich:
Â»Weil wir als Kinder geboren sind und von den sinnlichen Dingen vielerlei Urteile vorher gefÃ¤llt haben, ehe wir den vollkommenen Gebrauch unserer Vernunft hatten, so werden wir durch viele Vorurteile von der Kenntnis des Wahren abgestoÃŸen. Von diesen scheinen wir uns nicht anders befreien zu kÃ¶nnen, als wenn wir einmal im Leben an dem zu zweifeln streben, worin wir nur den geringsten Verdacht einer UngewiÃŸheit haben.Â«

> Â»Ja, es wird sogar nÃ¼tzlich sein, alles das, woran wir zweifeln, fÃ¼r falsch zu halten, damit wir desto klarer das finden, was das Gewisseste und Erkennbarste sei.Â«
Â»Doch ist dies Zweifeln auf die Betrachtung der Wahrheit einzuschrÃ¤nken. Denn was den usus vitae betrÃ¤fe, weil oft die Gelegenheit zum Handeln vorÃ¼berginge, ehe wir uns unsere Zweifel lÃ¶sen kÃ¶nnten, sind wir genÃ¶tigt, das Wahrscheinliche zu wÃ¤hlen.Â«
Â»Hier aber, wo es nur um das Suchen der Wahrheit zu tun ist, so werden wir vornehmlich zweifeln, ob irgend das Sinnliche und Vorstellbare existiere: erstens weil wir finden, daÃŸ die Sinne uns oft tÃ¤uschen und es der Klugheit gemÃ¤ÃŸ ist, dem nicht zu vertrauen, was uns nur einmal getÃ¤uscht hat; alsdann weil wir tÃ¤glich im Traume UnzÃ¤hliges zu fÃ¼hlen oder uns vorzustellen meinen, was niemals ist, und dem Zweifelnden keine solche Zeichen erscheinen, an denen er den Schlaf vom Wachen sicher unterscheide.Â«

> Â»Wir werden hiermit auch an allem andern zweifeln, selbst an den mathematischen SÃ¤tzen: teils weil wir gesehen, daÃŸ einige sich auch in dem irren, was uns fÃ¼r das Gewisseste gilt, und gelten lassen, was uns falsch scheint; dann weil wir gehÃ¶rt haben, daÃŸ ein Gott ist, der uns geschaffen, der alles kann, also vielleicht uns so geschaffen, daÃŸ wir irren sollen. â€“ Wenn wir uns einbilden, nicht von Gott, sondern von irgend etwas anderem, aus uns selbst, zu existieren, so ist es um so wahrscheinlicher, daÃŸ wir so unvollkommen sind, zu irren.Â«

> Â»So viel erfahren wir aber, die Freiheit in uns zu haben, daÃŸ wir uns immer dessen enthalten kÃ¶nnen, was nicht vÃ¶llig gewiÃŸ und ergrÃ¼ndet ist.Â«

> Das BedÃ¼rfnis, das bei diesen GrÃ¼nden des Descartes zugrunde liegt, ist, daÃŸ das Denken von sich anfangen soll; denn das Vorausgesetzte ist nicht durch das Denken gesetzt, ist ein Anderes des Denkens: das Denken ist nicht darin bei sich. Die sogenannte unmittelbare Anschauung, innere Offenbarung der neueren Zeit gehÃ¶rt auch hierher; vom Denken soll ausgegangen werden. Es ist das Interesse der Freiheit, was zugrunde liegt; was als wahr anerkannt wird, soll die Stellung haben, daÃŸ unsere Freiheit darin erhalten ist, daÃŸ wir denken. Hier in der cartesianischen Form ist das Prinzip der Freiheit als solches nicht herausgehoben, sondern es sind mehr populÃ¤re GrÃ¼nde: weil man irren kÃ¶nnte usf., darum soll man keine Voraussetzung machen.

> b) Das Gewisse. Cartesius suchte etwas an sich selbst Gewisses und Wahres, das weder nur wahr wÃ¤re wie der Gegenstand des Glaubens ohne Wissen, noch die sinnliche, auch skeptische GewiÃŸheit, die ohne Wahrheit ist. Das ganze Philosophieren war damit behaftet, etwas als wahr vorauszusetzen, teils, wie die neuplatonische Philosophie, die Form der Wissenschaft nicht ihrem Wesen zu geben oder die Momente desselben nicht auseinanderzusetzen. Nichts ist wahr, was nicht innere Evidenz im BewuÃŸtsein hat oder was die Vernunft nicht so deutlich und bÃ¼ndig erkennt, daÃŸ ein Zweifel daran schlechthin unmÃ¶glich. Ich hat die Bedeutung als Denken, nicht Einzelheit des SelbstbewuÃŸtseins. Der zweite Satz seiner Philosophie ist daher die unmittelbare GewiÃŸheit des Denkens. Wir mÃ¼ssen suchen, was gewiÃŸ ist; und das Gewisse ist die GewiÃŸheit, das Wissen als solches in seiner reinen Form als sich auf sich beziehend. Dies ist das Denken; so geht dann der unbeholfene Verstand weiter fort zum BedÃ¼rfnis des Denkens. Hiermit ist auf einmal die Philosophie in ein ganz anderes Feld, ganz anderen Standpunkt versetzt, nÃ¤mlich in die SphÃ¤re der SubjektivitÃ¤t, das Gewisse. Es wird aufgegeben Vorausgesetztes der Religion, nur das Beweisen gesucht, nicht der Inhalt. Es ist unendliche abstrakte SubjektivitÃ¤t; der absolute Inhalt verschwindet. Es ist ebenso dies GÃ¤rende, aus groÃŸem GefÃ¼hl, Anschauung zu sprechen, â€“ wie Bruno und so viele andere, jeder in seiner Weise, als IndividualitÃ¤ten ihre eigentÃ¼mliche Weltanschauung aussprechen.

> Â»Indem wir so alles wegwerfen oder es fÃ¼r falsch erklÃ¤ren, an dem wir auf irgendeine Weise zweifeln kÃ¶nnen, so ist es uns leicht, vorauszusetzen, daÃŸ kein Gott, kein Himmel, kein KÃ¶rper, aber darum nicht, daÃŸ wir nicht seien, die wir dieses denken. Denn es ist widersprechend (repugnat, â€“ es geht gegen den Mann), zu meinen, das, was denke, existiere nicht. Daher ist diese Erkenntnis, Ich denke, also bin ich, die erste von allen und die gewisseste, die sich jedem, der in Ordnung philosophiert, darbietet.Â«

> {#DescartesSchlechthingGewiss} Cartesius fÃ¤ngt also mit dem Standpunkt des Ich als des schlechthin Gewissen an, wie auch [[Fichte]] anfÃ¤ngt; ich weiÃŸ, es stellt sich in mir dar. Ein ganz anderer Boden ist so fÃ¼rs Philosophieren gegeben. Den Inhalt in sich selbst zu betrachten, ist nicht das Erste; nur Ich ist das Gewisse, Unmittelbare. Von allen meinen Vorstellungen kann ich abstrahieren. Das Denken ist das Erste; die nÃ¤chste Bestimmung, die hinzukommt, unmittelbar damit zusammenhÃ¤ngend, ist die Bestimmung des Seins. Ich denke, dies Denken enthÃ¤lt unmittelbar mein Sein; dies, sagt er, ist das absolute Fundament aller Philosophie. Die Bestimmung des Seins ist in meinem Ich; diese Verbindung selbst ist das Erste. Das Denken als Sein und das Sein als Denken, das ist meine GewiÃŸheit, Ich. Dies ist das berÃ¼hmte Cogito, ergo sum; Denken und Sein ist so darin unzertrennlich verbunden. Diesen Satz sieht man einerseits an als einen SchluÃŸ: aus dem Denken werde das Sein geschlossen. Und besonders hat Kant gegen diesen Zusammenhang eingewandt: im Denken sei nicht das Sein enthalten, es sei verschieden vom Denken. Dies ist wichtig, aber sie sind unzertrennlich, d.h. sie machen eine IdentitÃ¤t aus; was unzertrennlich ist, ist dennoch verschieden; aber die IdentitÃ¤t wird durch diese Verschiedenheit nicht gefÃ¤hrdet, sie sind Einheit. 

> Indessen ist dieser Ausspruch der reinen abstrakten GewiÃŸheit, die allgemeine TotalitÃ¤t, in der alles an sich, nicht bewiesen; man muÃŸ diese Proposition nicht in einen SchluÃŸ verwandeln wollen, Â»es ist ganz und gar kein SchluÃŸ. Denn dazu mÃ¼ÃŸte der Obersatz sein: alles, was denkt, existiertÂ«, â€“ und dazu die Subsumtion im Untersatze: Nun aber bin ich. Damit wÃ¼rde eben die Unmittelbarkeit aufgehoben, die darin liegt. Â»Aber jener ObersatzÂ« wird gar nicht aufgestellt, sondern Â»ist vielmehr erst ein abgeleiteter von dem ersten: Ich denke, also bin ich.Â« Zu einem Schlusse gehÃ¶ren drei Glieder, hier ein Drittes, wodurch Denken und Sein vermittelt wÃ¤re; so ist es aber nicht, â€“ nicht Ich denke, also so bin ich. Dies Also ist hier nicht das Also des Schlusses; es ist nur der Zusammenhang gesetzt von Sein und Denken. Alle anderen SÃ¤tze sind spÃ¤ter. Aber das Denken als Subjekt ist das Denkende, und das ist Ich; das Denken ist das innere Beimirsein, die Unmittelbarkeit bei mir, â€“ es ist das einfache Wissen selbst. Diese Unmittelbarkeit ist aber eben dasselbe, als was Sein heiÃŸt. Cartesius hat es nun zwar nicht so nachgewiesen, sondern sich einzig und allein auf das BewuÃŸtsein berufen. Auch Fichte hat spÃ¤ter mit derselben absoluten GewiÃŸheit, mit dem Ich, wieder angefangen, ist aber dazu fortgegangen, aus dieser Spitze dann alle Bestimmungen zu entwickeln. Also diese GewiÃŸheit ist das Prius. Wir denken zwar dieses und jenes, aber von diesem und jenem kÃ¶nnen wir abstrahieren, nicht so von dem Ich. Wir denken dies und jenes, deswegen sei es, ist die gewÃ¶hnliche altkluge Instanz der UnfÃ¤higkeit, das aufzufassen, wovon die Rede ist; daÃŸ bestimmter Inhalt sei, ist eben das, woran zu zweifeln ist, â€“ es gibt nichts Festes.

> Â»Dies ist der beste Weg, die Natur des Geistes und seine Verschiedenheit vom KÃ¶rper zu erkennen. Denn wenn wir untersuchen, wer wir sind, die wir alles, was von uns verschieden ist, als unwahr setzen kÃ¶nnen, so sehen wir deutlich, daÃŸ keine Ausdehnung, noch Figur, noch Ortsbewegung, noch etwas dergleichen, das dem KÃ¶rper zuzuschreiben ist, unsere Natur angehe, sondern das Denken allein; diese wird also frÃ¼her (prius) und gewisser als irgendeine kÃ¶rperliche Sache erkannt.Â«

> Es sind dagegen auch andere SÃ¤tze aufgestellt. Gassendi macht den Einwand Ludificor, ergo sum: Ich werde von meinem BewuÃŸtsein zum Besten gehabt, also existiere ich, â€“ eigentlich: also werde ich zum Besten gehabt. DaÃŸ etwas an diesem Einwurf daran ist, hat Descartes selbst gewuÃŸt. Aber Descartes widerlegt diesen Einwand hier selbst, indem nur das Ich, nicht der sonstige Inhalt festzuhalten ist. Das Sein nur ist identisch mit dem reinen Denken, der Inhalt mag sein, welcher er will; Ich ist gleich Denken. Er sagt: Â»Unter dem Denken begreife ich aber das alles, was mit unserem BewuÃŸtsein in uns vorgeht, insofern wir uns dessen bewuÃŸt sind; also auch Wollen, Einbilden (Vorstellen), auch Empfinden ist dasselbe, was DenkenÂ«, alles dies ist auch darin enthalten. Â»Denn wenn ich sage â€ºIch seheâ€¹ oder â€ºIch gehe spazieren, also bin ichâ€¹ und dies von dem Sehen, Gehen verstehe, das mit dem KÃ¶rper vollbracht wird, so ist der SchluÃŸ nicht absolut gewiÃŸÂ« (insofern ich das konkrete Ich meine), Â»weil, wie im Traum oft geschieht, ich meinen kann zu sehen, zu gehen, ob ich gleich die Augen nicht aufmache und mich nicht von der Stelle bewege, und vielleicht auch, wenn ich keinen KÃ¶rper hÃ¤tte. Aber wenn ich es von derÂ« (subjektiven) Â»Empfindung oder BewuÃŸtsein des Sehens oder Gehens selbst verstehe, weil sieÂ« (Empfindung und BewuÃŸtsein) Â»alsdann auf den Geist (mentem) bezogen wird, der allein empfindet oder denkt, er sehe oder gehe, so ist dieser SchluÃŸ alsdann ganz gewiÃŸ.Â«

> Â»Im TraumeÂ« ist Weise des empirischen RÃ¤sonnements; es muÃŸ nicht bloÃŸ heiÃŸen Â»weil Ich abstrahieren kannÂ«, sondern Â» $[$ weil $]$ eben Ich dies Einfache, mit sich Identische istÂ«. Ich sehe, Ich gehe usf., da ist Ich in der Bestimmung des Sehens, Gehens; aber ich bin darin auch denkend. Das Denken ist nun zwar auch im Wollen, Sehen, HÃ¶ren usw.; es ist absurd, zu meinen, die Seele habe das Denken in einer besonderen Tasche und anderwÃ¤rts das Sehen, Wollen usf. Aber wenn ich sage Â»Ich seheÂ«, Â»Ich gehe spazierenÂ«, so ist darin einerseits mein BewuÃŸtsein, Ich, und somit Denken; aber andererseits ist auch Wollen, Sehen, HÃ¶ren, Gehen darin, also noch eine weitere Modifikation des Inhalts. (Das Denken ist das Prius, das ganz Allgemeine; Denken ist das Ich, Denken als Denkendes ist Ich: es ist das Allgemeine, was auch im Wollen,[133] FÃ¼hlen, Gehen usf. ist.) Und wegen dieser Modifikation kann ich nicht sagen Â»Ich gehe, also bin ichÂ«; denn von der Modifikation kann ich ja abstrahieren, es ist nicht mehr das allgemeine Denken. Man muÃŸ also bloÃŸ auf das reine, in diesem Konkreten enthaltene BewuÃŸtsein sehen. Nur wenn ich heraushebe, daÃŸ ich darin als denkend bin, so liegt das reine Sein darin; und nur mit dem Allgemeinen ist das Sein verbunden. Es ist ganz leicht, diese IdentitÃ¤t einzusehen. Denken ist das ganz Allgemeine, nicht das Besondere; in allem Besonderen ist auch das Allgemeine. Das Denken ist die Beziehung auf sich selbst, ist das Allgemeine, das reine sich Beziehen auf sie selbst, das reine Einssein mit sie. Die Frage ist nun: was ist das Sein? Da muÃŸ man sich aber nicht das Sein eines konkreten Inhalts vorstellen. Sein ist dann nichts als die einfache Unmittelbarkeit, die reine Beziehung, IdentitÃ¤t mit sich; so ist es die Unmittelbarkeit, die auch das Denken ist. Das Denken ist dieselbe Unmittelbarkeit, zugleich aber auch die Vermittlung mit sich selbst, die sich ebenso auch negiert, also auch Unmittelbarkeit. Unmittelbarkeit ist eine einseitige Bestimmung; das Denken enthÃ¤lt sie, aber sie nicht allein, sondern auch die Bestimmung, sich mit sich selbst zu vermitteln; und dadurch, daÃŸ das Vermitteln zugleich Aufheben der Vermittlung ist, ist es Unmittelbarkeit. Im Denken ist so Sein; Sein ist eine arme Bestimmung, ist das Abstraktum von dem Konkreten des Denkens.

> Â»DaÃŸ das Denken (mens)Â«, sagt Cartesius, Â»mir gewisser ist als der KÃ¶rper, liegt darin. DaÃŸ ich urteile, die Erde existiere, daraus, daÃŸ ich sie berÃ¼hre oder sehe, daraus muÃŸ ich ja noch viel mehr urteilen, daÃŸ mein Denken (mens) existiert. Denn es kann vielleicht ebensogut sein, daÃŸ ich urteile, die Erde existiere, ob sie gleich nicht existiert, nicht aber, daÃŸ ich dies urteile und mein Geist (mens), der dies urteilt, nicht sei.Â« D.i. alles, das fÃ¼r mich ist, kann ich[134] setzen als nichtseiend, indem ich mich als nichtseiend setze, setze ich selbst, oder es ist mein Urteil. Denn daÃŸ ich urteile, das kann ich nicht weglassen, wenn ich auch von dem abstrahieren kann, worÃ¼ber ich urteile. Damit hat nun aber die Philosophie ihren eigentlichen Boden wiedergewannen, daÃŸ das Denken vom Denken ausgeht, als einem in sich Gewissen, nicht von etwas Ã„uÃŸerem, nicht von etwas Gegebenem, nicht von einer AutoritÃ¤t, sondern schlechthin von dieser Freiheit, die darin ist: Â»Ich denkeÂ«.
An allem anderen kann ich zweifeln, an dem Dasein kÃ¶rperlicher Dinge, an meinem KÃ¶rper selbst; oder diese GewiÃŸheit hat nicht die Unmittelbarkeit in sich. Denn Ich ist eben die GewiÃŸheit selbst, an allem anderen ist sie PrÃ¤dikat; mein KÃ¶rper ist mir gewiÃŸ, er ist nicht diese GewiÃŸheit selbst. Gegen die GewiÃŸheit, einen KÃ¶rper zu haben, fÃ¼hrt Cartesius die empirische Erscheinung an, daÃŸ oft die Vorstellung vorhanden ist, man fÃ¼hle Schmerzen in einem Gliede, das man schon lange nicht mehr hat. Was wirklich ist, ist eine Substanz, â€“ Seele die denkende Substanz; sie ist fÃ¼r sich, von allen Ã¤uÃŸeren materiellen Dingen verschieden und unabhÃ¤ngig. DaÃŸ sie denkend ist, ist fÃ¼r sich evident; sie wÃ¼rde denken und existieren, wenn auch keine materiellen Dinge vorhanden wÃ¤ren. Die Seele kann sich deswegen leichter erkennen als ihren KÃ¶rper.

> Alles weitere, was wir fÃ¼r wahr halten kÃ¶nnen, beruht auf dieser GewiÃŸheit; zum FÃ¼rwahrhalten gehÃ¶rt Evidenz. Nichts ist wahr, was nicht innere Evidenz im BewuÃŸtsein hat. Â»Die Evidenz von allem beruht nun darauf, daÃŸ wir es ebenso klar und deutlich einsehen als jene GewiÃŸheit selbst und daÃŸ es so von diesem Prinzip abhÃ¤ngt und mit ihm Ã¼bereinstimmt, daÃŸ, wenn wir daran zweifeln wollten, wir[135] auch an diesem PrinzipÂ« (an unserem Ich) Â»zweifeln mÃ¼ÃŸten.Â«

> c) Das Dritte ist der Obergang dieser GewiÃŸheit zur Wahrheit, zu Bestimmtem; diesen Ãœbergang macht Cartesius auf naive Weise. Dieses Wissen ist fÃ¼r sich nun die vollkommene Evidenz, GewiÃŸheit, aber es ist noch nicht die Wahrheit; oder wenn wir jenes Sein als Wahrheit nehmen, so ist dies ein leerer Inhalt, und um den Inhalt ist es zu tun. â€“ Die nÃ¤chste Betrachtung ist nun die der Metaphysik des Descartes. Die Einheit des Seins und des Denkens ist dabei das Erste, und das Denken wird dabei genommen als das reine Denken; Descartes hat diesen Satz aber nicht bewiesen. Es sind verschiedene Bestimmungen, Denken und Sein, â€“ und nur ihre Verschiedenheit muÃŸ aufgezeigt werden; daÃŸ sie identisch sind, diesen Beweis hat Descartes nicht gefÃ¼hrt. Es steht einstweilen voran, es ist die interessanteste Idee der neueren Zeit Ã¼berhaupt; er hat sie zuerst aufgestellt. Das BewuÃŸtsein ist seiner selbst gewiÃŸ; Â»Ich denkeÂ« â€“ damit ist gesetzt das Sein. Der Fortgang ist hier, daÃŸ ein Interesse entsteht fÃ¼r weitere Vorstellungen von der abstrakten Einheit; da geht er nun Ã¤uÃŸerlich reflektierend zu Werke. Â»Das BewuÃŸtsein, das nur sich selbst gewiÃŸ weiÃŸ, sucht nun aber seine Kenntnis zu erweitern und findet, daÃŸ es Vorstellungen von vielen Dingen hat, in welchen Vorstellungen es sich nicht tÃ¤uscht, solange es nicht behauptet oder negiert, daÃŸ ihnen etwas Ã„hnliches auÃŸer ihm entspreche.Â« Die TÃ¤uschung bei den Vorstellungen hat erst Sinn in Beziehung auf Ã¤uÃŸerliche Existenz. Â»Es findet auch allgemeine Begriffe und macht daraus Beweise, die evident sind; z.B. der geometrische Satz, daÃŸ die drei Winkel im Dreieck zusammen zwei rechten gleich seien ist eine Vorstellung, die an sich unwiderstehlich aus anderen folgt. Aber bei der Reflexion, ob es solche Dinge wirklich gebe, zweifelt es daranÂ«; es ist ja das Dreieck gar nicht gewiÃŸ.

> Die Ausdehnung ist nicht in der unmittelbaren GewiÃŸheit meiner selbst enthalten. Die Seele kann sein ohne das KÃ¶rperliche und dieses ohne sie; sie sind realiter verschieden, eins denkbar ohne das andere. Die Seele denkt und erkennt nicht das Andere ebenso deutlich als die GewiÃŸheit ihrer selbst. Die Wahrheit dieses Wissens beruht auf dem Beweise vom Dasein Gottes. Die Seele ist eine unvollkommene Substanz, hat aber die Idee von Vollkommenheit in sich, â€“ eines absolut vollkommenen Wesens; diese Idee ist nicht in ihr selbst erzeugt, weil sie unvollkommene Substanz ist, also angeboren. Das BewuÃŸtsein hierÃ¼ber drÃ¼ckt sich bei Descartes so aus, daÃŸ, solange Gottes Dasein nicht bewiesen und eingesehen ist, die MÃ¶glichkeit bleibt, daÃŸ wir uns tÃ¤uschen, weil man nicht wissen kann, ob wir nicht eine zum Irren eingerichtete Natur haben. Die Form ist etwas schief, drÃ¼ckt nur Ã¼berhaupt den Gegensatz aus, den das SelbstbewuÃŸtsein gegen das BewuÃŸtsein von anderem hat, von GegenstÃ¤ndlichem; und es ist um die Einheit von beiden zu tun, â€“ ob das, was im Denken ist, auch die GegenstÃ¤ndlichkeit habe. Diese Einheit liegt nun in Gott oder ist Gott selbst.

> Ich trage dies in der Weise des Cartesius vor: Â»Unter den verschiedenen Vorstellungen nun, die wir haben, ist auch die Vorstellung eines hÃ¶chst intelligenten, hÃ¶chst mÃ¤chtigen und absolut vollkommenen Wesens; und dies ist die vorzÃ¼glichste aller VorstellungenÂ«, â€“ die allbefassende, allgemeine Vorstellung. Î±) Es finden sich Vorstellungen; es ist ungewiÃŸ, ob sie sind. Î²) Eine ist ausgezeichnet; bei ihr findet diese UngewiÃŸheit nicht statt. Sie hat das EigentÃ¼mliche, daÃŸ Â»wir darin die Existenz nicht als eine bloÃŸ mÃ¶gliche und zufÃ¤llige erkennen, wie in den Vorstellungen anderer Dinge, die wir deutlich wahrnehmen, sondern als eine schlechthin notwendige und ewige Bestimmung. Wie der Geist z.B. wahrnimmt, daÃŸ im Begriffe des Dreiecks enthalten, die drei Winkel seien gleich zweien rechten, also habe das Dreieck sie, â€“ so daraus, daÃŸ er perzipiert, daÃŸ die Existenz notwendig und ewig in dem Begriffe des vollkommensten Wesens enthalten ist, muÃŸ er schlieÃŸen, daÃŸ das vollkommenste Wesen existiere.Â« Denn zur Vollkommenheit gehÃ¶rt auch die Bestimmung der Existenz; denn die Vorstellung von einem Nichtexistierenden ist weniger vollkommen. Da ist also die Einheit des Denkens und Seins und der ontologische Beweis vom Dasein Gottes; dies sahen wir nun schon frÃ¼her beim Anselm (s. Bd. 19, S. 554 ff.). Es wird gesagt: Das Allgemeine, was wir Gott nennen, ist das Vollkommenste. Und es entsteht nun die Frage: Ist es auch in der Existenz? Die Vorstellung des Vollkommensten enthÃ¤lt auch die Bestimmung der Existenz; sonst wÃ¤re es nicht das Vollkommenste.

> Descartes geht dazu so fort. Descartes hat das Axiom: Î±) Â»Es gibt verschiedene Grade der RealitÃ¤t oder EntitÃ¤t; denn die Substanz hat mehr RealitÃ¤t als das Akzidenz oder der Modus, â€“ die unendliche Substanz mehr als die endliche.Â« Dies ist ein Axiom bei Cartesius, eine unmittelbare GewiÃŸheit; aber diese Unterschiede sind nicht in Â»Ich denkeÂ«, â€“ es ist nach der Weise eines Erfahrungssatzes aufgestellt. Î²) Â»In dem Begriff eines Dings ist die Existenz enthalten, entweder die nur mÃ¶gliche oder die notwendigeÂ«, â€“ die unmittelbare GewiÃŸheit eines Andersseins, des Gegensatzes; es ist dem Ich ein Nicht-Ich entgegengesetzt, im Â»Ich denkeÂ« (Begriff) das Sein enthalten.

> Î³) Â»Kein Ding oder keine Vollkommenheit eines Dings, die wirklich actu existiert, kann zur Ursache ihrer Existenz das Nichts haben.Â« Dies ist ebenso evident als Ich denke. Â»Denn wenn von Nichts etwas prÃ¤diziert werden kÃ¶nnte, so kÃ¶nnte ebenso gut das Denken von ihm prÃ¤diziert werden, und ich wÃ¼rde also sagen, ich sei nichts, indem ich denke.Â« Das unmittelbare Wissen, die sinnliche GewiÃŸheit hat keine Notwendigkeit. â€“ Hier geht Descartes in eine Trennung, in ein VerhÃ¤ltnis Ã¼ber, das nicht erkannt ist; es kommt der Begriff von Ursache hinzu, der wohl ein Denken ist, aber ein bestimmtes Denken. Spinoza in seiner ErlÃ¤uterung sagt (p 14), Â»daÃŸ die Vorstellungen mehr oder weniger RealitÃ¤t enthalten und jene Momente ebenso viel Evidenz haben als das Denken selbst, weil sie nicht nur sagen, daÃŸ wir denken, sondern wie wir denkenÂ«. Aber diese bestimmten Weisen eben als Unterschiede in der Einfachheit des Denkens wÃ¤ren zu erweisen. Spinoza setzt noch zu diesem Ãœbergange hinzu (p. 17), daÃŸ Â»die Grade der RealitÃ¤t, welche wir in den Ideen wahrnehmen, nicht in den Ideen sind, sofern sie nur als Arten des Denkens betrachtet werden; sondern sofern die eine eine Substanz, eine andere nur einen Modus der Substanz vorstellt â€“ oder mit einem Worte, insofern sie als Vorstellungen von Dingen betrachtet werden.Â«

> d) Â»Die objektive RealitÃ¤t der BegriffeÂ« (d.h. die EntitÃ¤t des Vorgestellten, insofern es in dem Begriffe ist) Â»erfordert eine UrsacheÂ« (Sache an sich), Â»worin dieselbe RealitÃ¤t nicht nur objektivÂ« (d.h. im Begriffe), Â»sondern formell oder auch eminerter enthalten istÂ«; â€“ Â»formell, d.h. ebenso vollkommen; eminenter, vollkommener. Denn es muÃŸ wenigstens soviel in der Ursache sein als in der Wirkung.Â«

> Îµ) Â»Die Existenz Gottes wird unmittelbarÂ« (a priori) Â»aus der Betrachtung seiner Natur erkannt. DaÃŸ etwas in der Natur oder in dem Begriffe eines Dings enthalten ist, ist soviel als sagen, daÃŸ es wahr ist: die Existenz ist unmittelbar in dem Begriff Gottes enthalten; es ist also wahr, von ihm zu sagen, daÃŸ eine notwendige Existenz in ihm ist.Â« â€“ Â»In dem Begriffe jedes Dings ist entweder eine mÃ¶gliche oder eine notwendige Existenz enthalten: eine notwendige im Begriffe Gottes, d.h. des absolut vollkommenen Wesens; denn sonst wÃ¼rde er als unvollkommen begriffen.Â«
Descartes nimmt auch diese Wendung: Â»Proposition VI. A posteriori aus dem bloÃŸen Begriffe in uns die Existenz Gottes zu beweisen. Die objektive RealitÃ¤t eines Begriffes erfordert eine Ursache, in welcher dieselbe RealitÃ¤t nicht bloÃŸ objektivÂ« (als im Endlichen), Â»sondern formaliterÂ« (frei, rein fÃ¼r sich selbst, auÃŸer uns) Â»oder eminenterÂ« (und als ursprÃ¼nglich) Â»enthalten ist.Â« (Axiom VIII: Â»In der Ursache als solcher ist die RealitÃ¤t formell oder eminenter.Â«) Â»Wir haben aber einen Begriff von Gott, seine objektive RealitÃ¤t ist aber in uns weder formell noch eminenter enthalten und kann also nur in Gott selbst sein.Â«

> Wir sehen dann, daÃŸ diese Idee eine Voraussetzung ist. Wir finden in uns diese Idee, wÃ¼rde man jetzt sagen; daÃŸ dieses ist, das ist die hÃ¶chste Idee. Es ist also so vorausgesetzt; und wenn wir fragen, ob diese Idee existiere, so soll gerade dies die Idee sein, daÃŸ damit auch die Existenz gesetzt ist. Sagt man nÃ¤mlich, es ist nur eine Vorstellung, so widerspricht es dem Inhalt der Vorstellung. Aber es befriedigt hier nicht daÃŸ die Vorstellung so eingefÃ¼hrt wird: Wir haben diese Vorstellung, â€“ daÃŸ sie mithin so als ein Vorausgesetztes erscheint. Sodann ist nicht von diesem Inhalt an ihm selbst gezeigt, daÃŸ er sich zu dieser Einheit des Denkens und Seins bestimmt. Es ist hier in der Form von Gott keine andere Vorstellung gegeben, als die in Cogito, ergo sum, â€“ Sein und Denken unzertrennlich verbunden; hier haben wir die Gestalt einer Vorstellung, die ich in mir habe. Der ganze Inhalt dieser Vorstellung, der AllmÃ¤chtige, Allweise usf. sind PrÃ¤dikate, die sich erst spÃ¤ter ergeben; der Inhalt selbst ist der Inhalt der Idee, mit der Existenz, mit der Wirklichkeit verbunden. So sehen wir diese Bestimmungen aufeinander folgen auf eine Weise, die empirisch ist, die also nicht philosophisch beweisend ist, â€“ in der apriorischen Metaphysik Ã¼berhaupt Voraussetzungen von Vorstellungen und sie denken, wie in der Empirie Versuche, Beobachtungen, Erfahrungen.

> Cartesius sagt dann: Â»Und dies glaubt der Geist um so mehrÂ«, ist um so fester von dieser Einheit Ã¼berzeugt, Â»wenn er bemerkt, daÃŸ er die Vorstellung von keinem anderen Dinge bei sich findet, worin die Existenz als notwendig enthalten sei. Daraus wird er einsehen, daÃŸ jene Idee des hÃ¶chsten Wesens nicht von ihm erdichtet, noch etwas ChimÃ¤risches, sondern eine wahrhafte und unverÃ¤nderliche Natur die nicht anders als existieren kann, da die notwendige Existenz in ihr enthalten ist. â€“ Unsere Vorurteile hindern uns daran, dies leicht festzuhalten, da wir gewohnt sind, bei allem anderen die Essenz (Wesen, Begriff) von der Existenz zu unterscheiden.Â« DarÃ¼ber, daÃŸ das Denken nicht untrennbar sei von der Existenz, ist das gewÃ¶hnliche Gerede: Â»Wenn das wÃ¤re, was man sich denkt, so wÃ¼rde es anders stehen.Â« Aber man berÃ¼cksichtigt hierbei nicht, daÃŸ das immer ein besonderer Inhalt ist und daÃŸ darin gerade das Wesen der Endlichkeit der Dinge besteht, daÃŸ Begriff und Sein trennbar sind. Wie kann man aber von endlichen Dingen auf das Unendliche schlieÃŸen?

Â»Ferner dieser BegriffÂ«, fÃ¤hrt Cartesius fort, Â»ist nicht von uns gemacht.Â« Wir finden in uns diese Vorstellung; es ist eine ewige Vorstellung, eine ewige Wahrheit, â€“ dasselbe, was jetzt gesagt wird, daÃŸ es in uns geoffenbart ist. Â»Wir finden in uns die Perfektionen nicht, die in dieser Vorstellung. Also sind wir gewiÃŸ, daÃŸ eine Ursache, worin alle Perfektion, Gott als real existierend, sie uns gegeben [sei]; denn es ist uns gewiÃŸ, daÃŸ aus Nichts nichts entsteheÂ« (nach BÃ¶hme hat Gott die Materie der Welt aus sich selbst genommen) Â»und, was vollkommen, nicht die Wirkung von etwas Unvollkommenem sein kÃ¶nne.Â« Der Beweis der Existenz Gottes aus seiner Idee ist: In diesem Begriff ist das Dasein enthalten; also ist es wahr. Â»Von ihm mÃ¼ssen wir in der wahrhaften Wissenschaft alle erschaffenen Dinge ableiten.Â«

> Mit dem Erweise des Daseins Gottes wird zugleich die Evidenz aller Wahrheit in ihrem Ursprung und in ihrer GÃ¼ltigkeit begrÃ¼ndet. Gott als Ursache ist das FÃ¼rsichsein, die RealitÃ¤t, die nicht die EntitÃ¤t, Existenz im Denken ist. Eine solche Existenz, die Ursache (nicht Sache Ã¼berhaupt), liegt im Begriff des Nicht-Ich, nicht jedes bestimmten Begriffs -denn diese als bestimmte sind Negationen â€“, sondern nur der reinen Existenz oder der vollkommenen Ursache. Sie ist Ursache der Wahrheit der Ideen; denn sie eben ist die Seite des Seins derselben.

> d) Das Vierte ist nun, daÃŸ Cartesius sagt: Â»Was uns von Gott geoffenbart ist, mÃ¼ssen wir glauben, ob wir es gleich nicht begreifen. Es ist nicht zu verwundern, da wir endlich, daÃŸ in Gottes Natur als unbegreiflich Unendliches ist, das Ã¼ber unsere Fassung geht.Â« Das ist denn ein Hereinfallen einer gewÃ¶hnlichen Vorstellung. Â»Deswegen mÃ¼ssen wir uns nicht mit Untersuchungen Ã¼ber das Unendliche ermÃ¼den; denn da wir endlich, ist es ungereimt, etwas darÃ¼ber zu bestimmen.Â« So z.B. die Freiheit des Willens und die gÃ¶ttliche PrÃ¤szienz, â€“ beides ist uns gewiÃŸ; er ist nicht verlegen, wie sich dies vereinbare. Das aber lassen wir jetzt. â€“ Das Mysterium der Dreieinigkeit wird immer in uns geboren, sagt BÃ¶hme (s. S. 114 f.).

> Â»Das erste Attribut GottesÂ«, in dem diese Einheit ist, Â»ist nun, daÃŸ er wahrhaftig ist und der Geber alles Lichts; es ist seiner Natur also ganz zuwider, daÃŸ er uns tÃ¤uscht. Daher das Licht der Natur oder das ErkenntnisvermÃ¶gen, von Gott uns gegeben, kann kein Objekt berÃ¼hren, das nicht wahr wÃ¤re, insofern es von ihmÂ« (dem ErkenntnisvermÃ¶gen) Â»berÃ¼hrt wÃ¼rde, d. i. deutlich und klar eingesehen wird.Â« Gott schreiben wir Wahrhaftigkeit zu. Daraus folgert er also das Band zwischen dem Erkennen und der Wahrhaftigkeit, ObjektivitÃ¤t dessen, was wir erkennen. Das Erkennen hat GegenstÃ¤nde, hat einen Inhalt, der erkannt wird; diesen Zusammenhang heiÃŸen wir dann Wahrheit. Die Wahrhaftigkeit Gottes ist gerade dieses, die Einheit des Gedachten und des Seienden. Â»Dadurch wird nun der Zweifel gehoben, als ob es sein kÃ¶nnte, daÃŸ das nicht wahr wÃ¤re, was uns ganz evident ist. Mathematische Wahrheiten dÃ¼rfen uns also nicht mehr verdÃ¤chtig sein. Ebenso, wenn wir auf das acht geben, was wir in den Sinnen, im Wachen oder im Schlaf klar und deutlich unterscheiden, so ist es leicht, in jeder Sache zu erkennen, was in ihr Wahres ist.Â«

> Â»Es ist gewiÃŸ, wegen Gottes Wahrhaftigkeit, daÃŸ das VermÃ¶gen zu perzipieren und das VermÃ¶gen, durch den Willen zuzustimmen (assentiendi), wenn es sich nur auf das klar Perzipierte erstreckt, nicht auf Irrtum gehen (tendere in falsum) kÃ¶nne. Wenn dies auch auf keine Weise bewiesen werden kÃ¶nnte, so ist so fest von Natur in allen, daÃŸ, sooft wir etwas deutlich perzipieren, wir ihm von selbst (sponte) beistimmen und auf keine Weise zweifeln kÃ¶nnen, daÃŸ es wahr ist.Â« Dies alles ist hÃ¶chst naiv und schlicht hererzÃ¤hlt, aber unbestimmt; es bleibt formell, ohne Tiefe, â€“ es ist eben so. Die Wahrhaftigkeit Gottes ist das absolute Band des von uns klar Eingesehenen und der Ã¤uÃŸeren RealitÃ¤t. Der Gang bei Cartesius ist der Gang des klaren Verstandes. GewiÃŸheit ist das Erste; davon wird nicht Inhalt notwendig abgeleitet, weder Inhalt Ã¼berhaupt, noch weniger seine ObjektivitÃ¤t als unterschieden von der inneren SubjektivitÃ¤t des Ich. Sondern es wird gesagt, wir finden in uns die Idee des Vollkommensten; die Vorstellung wird hier als gefundene vorausgesetzt. Daran wird gemessen die bloÃŸe Vorstellung von Gott, die keine Existenz in sich enthÃ¤lt; und es wird gefunden, daÃŸ sie ohne Existenz unvollkommen wÃ¤re. Diese Einheit Gottes selbst, seiner Idee mit seinem Dasein, ist allerdings die Wahrhaftigkeit; an dieser haben wir ebenso den Grund, das fÃ¼r wahr zu halten, was fÃ¼r uns ebenso gewiÃŸ ist, als die Wahrheit unserer selbst.

> Was gedacht wird richtig und klar, das ist so. Es ist also ausgesprochen, daÃŸ der Mensch durch das Denken erfahre, was in der Tat an den Dingen ist. Die Quellen der IrrtÃ¼mer liegen in der Endlichkeit unserer Natur. In der weiteren AusfÃ¼hrung liegt bei Cartesius das zugrunde, was Ã¼berhaupt gedacht, und nur insofern es ein Gedachtes, Allgemeines ist, Wahrheit habe. Hiermit ist Gottes Wahrhaftigkeit zum absoluten Band zwischen dem absoluten Erkennen und der Wirklichkeit dessen, was so erkannt wird, gesetzt. DaÃŸ dieses erste Attribut Gottes das Band ist zwischen dem subjektiven klaren und deutlichen Denken und der ObjektivitÃ¤t, hat ein Cartesianer, wenn man ihn anders so nennen darf, Malebranche, den man hier gleich erwÃ¤hnen kÃ¶nnte, in seiner Recherche de la vÃ©ritÃ©, wie wir sehen werden, noch bestimmter ausgedrÃ¼ckt, noch enger zusammengezogen. â€“ Wir haben hier diesen Gegensatz: subjektives Erkennen und die Wirklichkeit. Das eine Mal ist gesagt, sie sind beide unzertrennlich verbunden; Denken ist Sein. Das andere Mal werden sie verschieden betrachtet; da tritt nun das BedÃ¼rfnis ein, sie zu vermitteln. Auf dem Vermitteln beruht der Beweis dieser Einheit. Hier ist nun unser Erkennen vorgestellt und auf der andern Seite die Wirklichkeit; als das Vermittelnde wird die Wahrhaftigkeit Gottes gesetzt. Diese Wahrhaftigkeit oder die Wahrheit Gottes ist, daÃŸ seine Idee unmittelbar die Wirklichkeit in sich enthÃ¤lt; Begriff und seine RealitÃ¤t nennen wir Wahrheit. â€“ Dies sind so die Grundbestimmungen.

> Dies ist die Idee, die in dieser Metaphysik zugrunde liegt: Î±) Von der GewiÃŸheit seiner selbst zur Wahrheit zu kommen, im Begriffe des Denkens das Sein zu erkennen. In jenem Denken Â»Ich denkeÂ« bin ich Einzelner; das Denken als ein subjektives schwebt vor; nicht im Begriff des Denkens selbst wird das Sein aufgezeigt, zur Trennung Ã¼berhaupt fortgegangen. Î²) Das Negative des Seins fÃ¼r das SelbstbewuÃŸtsein schwebt ebenso vor; und dies Negative, vereinigt mit dem positiven Ich, ist als an sich vereinigt in einem Dritten, in Gott gesetzt. In ihm ist Denken und Sein dasselbe; eben im Negativen, im Begriffe, Gedachtsein desselben ist das Sein. Î±) Ein Einwurf ist schon alt, auch Kantisch, daÃŸ aus dem Begriffe des vollkommensten Wesens mehr nicht folgt, als daÃŸ im Gedanken Dasein und vollkommenstes Wesen verknÃ¼pft sind, nicht aber auÃŸer dem Gedanken. Allein eben der Begriff des Daseins ist dies Negative des SelbstbewuÃŸtseins, nicht auÃŸer dem Gedanken, sondern Gedanke von dem AuÃŸer des Denkens. Î²) Gott â€“ vorher MÃ¶glichkeit, kein Widerspruch â€“ hat gegenstÃ¤ndliche Form fÃ¼r das SelbstbewuÃŸtsein, ist alle RealitÃ¤t, insofern sie positiv, d.h. eben Sein, Einheit des Denkens und Seins, vollkommenstes Wesen. Sein nimmt er nun in dem ganz positiven Sinne und hat nicht den Begriff davon, daÃŸ es eben das Negative des SelbstbewuÃŸtseins ist.

> 2. Das einfache Sein als Negatives des SelbstbewuÃŸtseins gesetzt, ist es die Ausdehnung; und Descartes negiert also von Gott die Ausdehnung, bleibt bei dieser Trennung stehen, verknÃ¼pft das Universum, die Materie, so mit Gott, daÃŸ er SchÃ¶pfer, Ursache desselben sei, und hat den richtigen Gedanken, daÃŸ die Erhaltung eine fortgesetzte SchÃ¶pfung ist, sofern die SchÃ¶pfung als TÃ¤tigkeit getrennt gesetzt wird, â€“ aber fÃ¼hrt eben die Ausdehnung nicht auf wahrhafte Weise zurÃ¼ck in das Denken.

> Gott ist die Ursache des Universums. Die Materie â€“ ausgedehnte Substanzen â€“ steht den denkenden Substanzen gegenÃ¼ber, die einfach sind. Sofern das Universum von Gott erschaffen ist, konnte es nicht so vollkommen sein als seine Ursache. (Die Wirkung ist unvollkommener als die Ursache, ist Gesetztsein, wenn beim Verstandesbegriffe der Ursache stehengeblieben wird; Ausdehnung ist schon das Unvollkommenere, aber nicht deduziert.) Als unvollkommen kÃ¶nnen sie nicht durch sich selbst oder ihren Begriff existieren und bestehen; sie bedÃ¼rfen also jeden Moment der Assistenz Gottes zu ihrer Erhaltung, ohne diese wÃ¼rden sie augenblicklich in nichts zurÃ¼cksinken. Erhaltung ist unaufhÃ¶rliche Wiederhervorbringung.

> Descartes geht nun zu weiteren Bestimmungen fort und sagt folgendes: Â»Das, was unter unser BewuÃŸtsein fÃ¤llt, betrachten wir entweder als Dinge oder deren Eigenschaften oder als ewige Wahrheiten, die keine Existenz auÃŸer unserem Denken habenÂ«, â€“ die nicht dieser oder jener Zeit, diesem oder jenem Orte angehÃ¶ren. Die letzten nennt er nun uns eingeboren, die nicht von uns gemacht sind, nicht empfunden und der ewige Begriff des Geistes selbst und die ewigen Bestimmungen seiner Freiheit, seiner selbst als seiner sind.

> Von hier geht die Vorstellung aus, ob die Ideen angeboren sind (innatae ideae). So sagt Cicero, die Natur habe sie in uns gepflanzt. Dieser Ausdruck, ewige Wahrheit, ist bis auf die neuesten Zeiten ganz gebrÃ¤uchlich. Ewige Wahrheiten sind allgemeine, ganz allgemeine Bestimmungen, ganz allgemeiner Zusammenhang; und von diesen ist hier vorgestellt, daÃŸ sie uns angeboren sind. Angeboren ist ein schlechter Ausdruck, weil dies eine natÃ¼rliche Weise bezeichnet; er paÃŸt nicht fÃ¼r den Geist, wegen der physischen Geburt. Wir wÃ¼rden sagen, es liege dies in der Natur, im Wesen unseres Geists begrÃ¼ndet. Der Geist ist tÃ¤tig und verhÃ¤lt sich in seiner TÃ¤tigkeit auf eine bestimmte Weise; diese hat aber keinen anderen Grund als seine Freiheit. DaÃŸ dies aber so sei, dazu gehÃ¶rt mehr, als es nur zu sagen; es mÃ¼ÃŸte abgeleitet werden als notwendiges Produzieren unseres Geistes. Diese ewigen Wahrheiten sind fÃ¼r sich. Solche logische Gesetze sind z.B.: Â»Aus Nichts wird NichtsÂ«; Â»etwas kann nicht zugleich sein und nicht sein.Â« Das sind Fakta des BewuÃŸtseins; ebenso moralische GrundsÃ¤tze. Cartesius verlÃ¤ÃŸt diese bald wieder; sie sind nur im Denken als subjektivem, er hat noch nicht nach ihrem Inhalt gefragt.

> {#DescartesSubstance} Was nun die Dinge betrifft, zu deren Betrachtung Cartesius Ã¼bergeht, das Andere zu diesen ewigen Wahrheiten, so sind die allgemeinen Bestimmungen der Dinge Substanz, Dauer, Ordnung usf. Von diesen gibt er dann Definitionen. Er legt zugrunde, man mÃ¼sse keine Voraussetzungen machen; und die Vorstellungen, zu denen er dann Ã¼bergeht, diese nimmt er als ein Gefundenes auf in unserem BewuÃŸtsein. Er definiert sie; die allgemeinen Gedanken, Kategorien, wie Aristoteles, sucht er auf. Er definiert nun die Substanz so: Â»Unter Substanz verstehe ich nichts anderes als eine Sache (rem), die keines anderen Etwas zum Existieren bedarf; und als eine solche Substanz, die keiner anderen Sache bedarf, kann nur eine einzige angesehen werden, nÃ¤mlich Gott.Â« Das ist, was Spinoza sagt; man kann sagen, es sei auch die wahrhafte Definition, die Einheit der Idee und der RealitÃ¤t. Solche Substanz ist nun Gott; die anderen, die wir Substanzen nennen, existieren nicht fÃ¼r sich, haben ihre Existenz nicht im Begriff selbst. Â»Alle anderenÂ« (Dinge) Â»kÃ¶nnen nur vermÃ¶ge eines concursus (einer Assistenz) Dei existieren.Â« Das Zusammenkommen von Seele und Leib bewirke so Gott; das nannte man System der Assistenz. Gott ist das absolut VerknÃ¼pfende von Begriff und Wirklichkeit; die Anderen, die Endlichen, die eine Grenze haben, in AbhÃ¤ngigkeit stehen, bedÃ¼rfen eines Anderen; die allgemeine VerknÃ¼pfung ist nun Gott. Â»HeiÃŸen wir daher auch andere Dinge Substanzen, so kommt ihnen und Gott dieser Ausdruck nicht, wie man in den Schulen sagt, univoce zu; d.h. es kann keine bestimmte Bedeutung dieses Worts angegeben werden, die Gott und den Kreaturen gemeinschaftlich wÃ¤re.Â«
Â»Ich anerkenne aber nicht mehr als zweierlei Gattungen der Dinge: nÃ¤mlich die eine ist die Gattung der denkenden und die andere die Gattung der Dinge, die sich auf das Ausgedehnte beziehen.Â« Da haben wir diesen Unterschied vom Denken und vom Ausgedehnten, RÃ¤umlichen, AuÃŸereinander. Das Denken, Begriff, Geistiges, SelbstbewuÃŸtes ist das, was bei sich ist, und hat den Gegensatz des Nichtbeisichseienden, Ausgedehnten, Unfreien. Dies ist der reale Unterschied (distinctio realis) der Substanzen: Â»Die Eine kann deutlich und bestimmt gefaÃŸt werden (intelligi) ohne die andere.Â« Â»Die kÃ¶rperliche und die denkende erschaffene Substanz kÃ¶nnen aber darum unter diesen gemeinschaftlichen Begriff gefaÃŸt werden, weil sie Dinge sind, die allein Gottes concursus zum Existieren bedÃ¼rfen.Â« Sie sind allgemeiner; die anderen endlichen Dinge bedÃ¼rfen anderer Dinge, Bedingungen zu ihrer Existenz. Aber die ausgedehnte Substanz, das Reich der Natur, und die geistige Substanz bedÃ¼rfen einander nicht. Man kann sie Substanzen nennen, weil jedes dieser ganze Umfang, eine TotalitÃ¤t fÃ¼r sich ist; jedes der beiden, das Ganze jeder Seite, kann ohne das Andere gefaÃŸt werden. Diese bedÃ¼rfen nur der Konkurrenz Gottes; d.h. das Reich des Denkens ist eine TotalitÃ¤t in sich, und die Natur ist ebenso ein totales System. Darum sind sie also auch (schloÃŸ nun Spinoza) an sich identisch, absolut identisch als Gott, die absolute Substanz; fÃ¼r den denkenden Geist ist dieses Ansich Gott, oder ihre Unterschiede sind ideelle. â€“ Cartesius geht vom Begriff Gottes zum Erschaffenen, Denken und Ausdehnung, und von da ins Besondere.
Â»Die Substanzen haben nun mehrere Attribute, ohne die sie nicht gedacht werden kÃ¶nnenÂ«, â€“ ihre Bestimmtheit; Â»jede hat aber ein solches EigentÃ¼mliches, das ihre Natur und Essenz ausmachtÂ« (einfache, allgemeine Bestimmtheit) Â»und worauf sich die anderen alle beziehen. So macht das Denken das absolute Attribut des Geistes ausÂ«, Denken ist seine QualitÃ¤t; Ausdehnung ist die wesentliche Bestimmung der KÃ¶rperlichkeit, und nur dies ist Â»die wahrhafte Natur des KÃ¶rpers. Alles andere ist nur ein Modus, wie Figur, Bewegung im Ausgedehnten: Einbildungskraft, Empfindung Wille im Denkenden.Â« Â»Gott ist die unerschaffene, denkende Substanz.Â«

> Hier geht nun Cartesius zum Einzelnen; an der Ausdehnung sind wieder zwei Bestimmungen, Materie und Bewegung. Er verfolgt das Ausgedehnte, kommt auf Materie, Ruhe, Bewegung. â€“ Ein Hauptgedanke Descartes' ist nun Ã¼ber die Materie; er faÃŸt das Wesen des KÃ¶rpers nur als Ausdehnung. Nach Descartes ist die Natur des KÃ¶rpers vollendet durch sein Ausgedehntsein; KÃ¶rper ist er, insofern er ausgedehnt ist, nicht insofern er andere QualitÃ¤ten hat. Alles andere, was wir als QualitÃ¤ten der KÃ¶rper gelten lassen, sind nur sekundÃ¤re QualitÃ¤ten, Modi usf.; sie kÃ¶nnen weggenommen und weggedacht werden. Wir sagen: Der KÃ¶rper leistet auch Widerstand, hat Geruch, Geschmack, Farbe; ohne solche ist kein KÃ¶rper. Materie, KÃ¶rperlichkeit, Ausdehnung ist fÃ¼r den Gedanken (nach Cartesius) ganz dasselbe. Die kÃ¶rperliche Welt soll gedacht werden, es soll also nur dies von ihr aufgenommen werden; das ist das Wesentliche derselben, was fÃ¼r den Gedanken ist. Die weiteren Bestimmungen des Ausgedehnten halten sich innerhalb dieser SphÃ¤re: Quantum von Ausdehnung, Ruhe, Bewegung, TrÃ¤gheit. Diese anderen Eigenschaften der KÃ¶rper sind etwas bloÃŸ Sinnliches, und das weist Cartesius nach, wie es schon lÃ¤ngst von den Skeptikern gezeigt worden ist.

> Jenes ist allerdings der abstrakte Begriff oder das reine Wesen; aber eben zum KÃ¶rper oder in das reine Wesen gehÃ¶rt notwendig NegativitÃ¤t, Verschiedenheit. DaÃŸ dies das Wesen des KÃ¶rpers ist, zeigt er dadurch, daÃŸ alle Bestimmungen desselben ausgelÃ¶scht, keine absolut prÃ¤diziert werden kann (auÃŸer Ausdehnung): Farbe, Durchsichtigkeit, HÃ¤rte usf.; Materie und Ausdehnung sind identisch. â€“ Er unterstÃ¼tzte dies durch folgenden Grund. Auf die SoliditÃ¤t, HÃ¤rte (FÃ¼rsichsein) der Materie schlieÃŸen wir durch den Widerstand, den ein KÃ¶rper unserer BerÃ¼hrung entgegensetzt und vermÃ¶ge derer er seinen Ort zu behaupten sucht. Nun nehme man an, daÃŸ die Materie, sowie wir sie berÃ¼hren, immer zurÃ¼ckwiche, wie der Raum, so hÃ¤tten wir keinen Grund, ihr SoliditÃ¤t beizumessen. Geruch, Farbe, Geschmack sind nur sinnliche Eigenschaften; wahr ist nur, was wir deutlich einsehen. Wenn ein KÃ¶rper in kleine Teile zerrieben wird, so weicht er auch und verliert doch seine Natur nicht; Widerstand ist also nicht wesentlich. Dieses NichtfÃ¼rsichsein ist aber nur quantitativ geringerer Widerstand; dieser bleibt immer. Cartesius will aber nur denken; Widerstand, Farbe usw. denkt er nicht, er faÃŸt es nur als sinnlich. Er sagt, alles dieses mÃ¼sse auf die Ausdehnung, als besondere Modifikation derselben, zurÃ¼ckgefÃ¼hrt werden; es macht dem Cartesius Ehre, nur das Gedachte fÃ¼r wahr zu nehmen. â€“ Allerdings aber eben jenes Aufheben ist die negative Bewegung des Denkens; das Wesen ist bedingt durch dieses Denken, d.h. es ist nicht wahres Wesen.
Von dem Begriff der Ausdehnung geht nun Descartes zu Gesetzen der Bewegung Ã¼ber, als dem allgemeinen Erkennen des Ansich des KÃ¶rperlichen: Î±) daÃŸ es kein Vakuum gibt, eine Ausdehnung ohne kÃ¶rperliche Substanz, d.h. KÃ¶rper ohne KÃ¶rper; Î²) keine Atome (kein FÃ¼rsichsein, IndividualitÃ¤t), aus demselben Grunde, das Wesen des KÃ¶rpers ist Ausdehnung; Î³) ferner daÃŸ ein KÃ¶rper durch etwas auÃŸer ihm in Bewegung gesetzt werde, fÃ¼r sich im Zustande der Ruhe beharre und ebenso im Zustande der Bewegung durch ein Anderes auÃŸer ihm zur Ruhe gebracht werden mÃ¼sse (TrÃ¤gheit); nichtssagende SÃ¤tze, es ist eben Abstraktion, einfache Ruhe und Bewegung in ihrem Gegensatze festzuhalten.

> {#DescartesMechanism} Ausdehnung und Bewegung sind die Grundbegriffe der mechanischen Physik; sie sind, was die Wahrheit der KÃ¶rperwelt ist. IdealitÃ¤t schwebt dem Descartes vor; er ist weit erhaben Ã¼ber die RealitÃ¤t der sinnlichen Eigenschaften, aber geht nicht zur Besonderung dieser IdealitÃ¤t Ã¼ber. â€“ Er bleibt also bei der eigentlichen Mechanik stehen. Gebt mir Materie (Ausgedehntes) und Bewegung, und ich will euch Welten bauen, sagt insofern Cartesius; Raum und Zeit waren ihm so die einzigen Bestimmungen des materiellen Universums. Darin liegt denn die mechanische Weise, die Natur zu betrachten, oder daÃŸ die Naturphilosophie des Descartes rein mechanisch ist, so daÃŸ er alle VerhÃ¤ltnisse auf Ruhe und Bewegung zurÃ¼ckfÃ¼hrt, alle materielle Verschiedenheit, Farbe, Geschmack auf Mechanik, Bewegung von Partikeln. Das VerÃ¤ndern der Materie ist daher allein die Bewegung; auf den Mechanismus mÃ¼ssen daher alle kÃ¶rperlichen Eigenschaften und animalischen Erscheinungen zurÃ¼ckgefÃ¼hrt werden. Im Lebendigen sind Verdauung usf. solche mechanische Effekte, deren Prinzipien Ruhe und Bewegung sind. Wir sehen hier also den Grund, den Ursprung der mechanischen Philosophie; die Mechanik ist von Cartesius ausgebildet worden. Es ist aber eine weitere Einsicht, daÃŸ dies unbefriedigend ist, â€“ Materie und Bewegung nicht hinreicht, um das Lebendige zu erklÃ¤ren. Es ist aber das GroÃŸe darin, daÃŸ das Denken in seinen Bestimmungen fortgeht und daÃŸ es diese Gedankenbestimmungen zu dem Wahrhaften der Natur macht.

> Extension and motion are the fundamental conceptions in mechanical physics; they represent the truth of the corporeal world. It is thus that ideality comes before the mind of Descartes, and he is far elevated above the reality of the sensuous qualities, although he does not reach so far as to the separation of this ideality. He thus remains at the point of view of mechanism pure and simple. Give me matter (extension) and motion and I will build worlds for you, is what Descartes virtually says.(33) Space and time were hence to him the only determinations of the material universe. In this, then, lies the mechanical fashion of viewing nature, or the natural philosophy of Descartes is seen to be purely mechanical.(34) Hence changes in matter are due merely to motion, so that Descartes traces every relationship to the rest and movement of particles, and all material diversity such as colour, and taste â€” in short, all bodily qualities and animal phenomena â€” to mechanism. In living beings processes such as that of digestion are mechanical effects which have as principles, rest and movement. We here see the ground and origin of the mechanical philosophy; but further on we find that this is unsatisfactory, for matter and motion do not suffice to explain life. Yet the great matter in all this is that thought goes forward in its determinations, and that it constitutes from these thought-determinations the truth of nature.

> Von da geht Descartes zur Mechanik Ã¼ber; Weltsystem, Bewegung der himmlischen KÃ¶rper betrachtet er. Er kommt nun auf Bewegung und Ruhe, Erde, Sonne usf., von da aus auf seine Vorstellung der in sich zurÃ¼ckgehenden Bewegung der HimmelskÃ¶rper in der Form von Wirbeln, auf Reflexionen, metaphysische Hypothesen vom Aus- und EinstrÃ¶men, Durchgehen, Sich-Begegnen usw. kleiner Partikelchen in Poren, zuletzt auch auf Salpeter und SchieÃŸpulver. Zuerst sollen die allgemeinen Gedanken das Interesse haben; das andere, was bei der AusfÃ¼hrung insbesondere zu bemerken ist, ist dieses. Das Weitere ist ein Ãœbergang zum Bestimmten; und dies Bestimmte, Physikalische wird errichtet in einer Physik, die das Resultat von Beobachtungen und Erfahrungen ist. In der weiteren AusfÃ¼hrung geht er ganz auf verstÃ¤ndige Weise fort. Descartes hat so viele Beobachtungen mit einer solchen Metaphysik vermischt; und dies ist[152] fÃ¼r uns daher etwas TrÃ¼bes. â€“ Professor Cousin in Paris hat Descartes' Werke neu herausgegeben, II BÃ¤nde in Oktav; der grÃ¶ÃŸte Teil besteht in Briefen Ã¼ber physikalische GegenstÃ¤nde.

> {#DescartesNonSpeculative} Bei dieser Philosophie ist die denkende Behandlung des Empirischen vorherrschend; auf eben diese Weise zeigen sich die Philosophien von dieser Zeit an. Die Philosophie hatte bei Descartes und anderen noch die unbestimmtere Bedeutung, durchs Denken, Nachdenken, RÃ¤sonieren zu erkennen. Das spekulative Erkennen, Ableiten aus dem Begriffe, freie selbstÃ¤ndige Entwicklung des Begriffs ist erst durch Fichte eingefÃ¼hrt. Es ist somit das, was jetzt philosophisches Erkennen und was sonst wissenschaftliches Erkennen heiÃŸt, nicht geschieden. Es rechnete sich also damals alle menschliche Wissenschaft zum Philosophieren; und bei Descartes' Metaphysik sahen wir das ganz empirische RÃ¤sonieren aus GrÃ¼nden, aus Erfahrungen, Tatsachen, Erscheinungen auf die naivste Weise eintreten. Das Wissenschaftliche dabei bestand Ã¼berhaupt nÃ¤her, strenger in der Methode des Beweisens, wie sie in der Geometrie lÃ¤ngst gebraucht worden, und in der gewÃ¶hnlichen Weise des formell logischen SchlieÃŸens.

> Daher geschieht es denn auch, daÃŸ das Philosophieren, das ein Ganzes von Wissenschaften ausmachen soll, anfÃ¤ngt von Logik und Metaphysik; dann der weitere Teil ist eine gewÃ¶hnliche Physik, Mathematik, freilich mit metaphysischen Spekulationen vermischt; und der dritte, die Ethik, betrifft die Natur des Menschen, seine Pflichten, Staat, den BÃ¼rger. So Descartes. Der erste Teil der Principia philosophiae handelt De principiis cognitionis humanae, der zweite De principiis rerum materialium. Diese Philosophie Ã¼ber die Ausdehnung (die Naturphilosophie) ist jedoch nichts anderes, als was damals eine ganz gewÃ¶hnliche Physik, Mechanik sein konnte, und noch ganz hypothetisch. Wir unterscheiden genau empirische Physik und Naturphilosophie, die erste ist auch denkend; die Naturphilosophie heiÃŸt so immer bei den[153] EnglÃ¤ndern dasselbe, als was wir Physik nennen (Newton).

> 3. Das andere ist Philosophie des Geistes, zum Teil metaphysisch, hernach aber auch empirisch; Cartesius hat besonders die Physik ausgebildet. Zu dem dritten Teil, dem ethischen, ist er nicht gekommen; Ethik machte er nicht bekannt, nur einen Traktat De passionibus. Spinozas philosophisches Hauptwerk dagegen ist die Ethik. Bei ihm ist der erste Teil auch allgemeine Metaphysik; den zweiten, die Naturphilosophie, hat er gar nicht behandelt, sondern nur eine Ethik, Philosophie des Geistes. Und das, was das Erkennen betriffe, den intelligenten Geist, das kommt im ersten Teil, in den Prinzipien der menschlichen Erkenntnis vor. So handelt auch Hobbes zuerst von der Logik, dann von einer ganz gewÃ¶hnlichen Physik: Sectio I, De corpore: Pars I, Logica s. Computatio; Pars II, Philosophia prima, Ontologie, Metaphysik; Pars III, Mechanik, Physik, menschliche Organe. Sectio II sollte von der Natur des Menschen handeln, Ethik; das Geistige hat er nicht vollstÃ¤ndig ausgebildet, nur De cive geschrieben. In Descartes' Metaphysik ist einem ganz naiv, gar nicht spekulativ zumute. â€“ Bei Cartesius war ferner zwar das Prinzip Denken, aber dieses Denken ist noch abstrakt und einfach; das Konkrete steht noch drÃ¼ben auf der andern Seite, und konkreteren Inhalt erhielt dieses Denken erst aus der Erfahrung. Das BedÃ¼rfnis, das Bestimmte aus dem Denken zu entwickeln, war noch nicht vorhanden.

> Cartesius handelt auf der andern Seite auch vom Denken; er handelt von der menschlichen Freiheit. Die Freiheit bewies Descartes daraus, daÃŸ die Seele denkt, der Wille unbeschrÃ¤nkt ist; und das macht die Vollkommenheit des Menschen aus. Das ist ganz richtig. In Ansehung der Freiheit kommt er auf die Schwierigkeit: Der Mensch als frei kÃ¶nne etwas tun, was nicht von Gott vorher angeordnet sei, â€“ das streitet gegen Allmacht und Allwissenheit Gottes; und wenn alles von Gott angeordnet, so wÃ¤re damit die menschliche Freiheit wieder aufgehoben. â€“ Diese beiden Bestimmungen lÃ¶sen sich nicht als widersprechende auf: Â»Der menschliche Geist ist endlich, Gottes Macht und Vorausbestimmung unendlich; wir sind nicht fÃ¤hig, das VerhÃ¤ltnis zu beurteilen, in welchem die Freiheit der menschlichen Seele zur gÃ¶ttlichen Allmacht und Allwissenheit stehe; aber im SelbstbewuÃŸtsein haben wir ihre GewiÃŸheit als Tatsache. Wir mÃ¼ssen uns aber nur an dem, was gewiÃŸ ist, halten.Â« Fernerhin erscheint ihm vielerlei als unerklÃ¤rbar; wir sehen ZÃ¤higkeit, Eigensinn, dabei nach bester Einsicht zu bleiben. Die Weise des Erkennens, wie Cartesius sie angibt, hat auch Gestalt eines verstÃ¤ndigen RÃ¤sonnements; so ist es ohne besonderes Interesse.

> Dies sind nun die Hauptmomente des Cartesischen Systems. Es sind noch einige einzelne Behauptungen anzufÃ¼hren, die ihn besonders berÃ¼hmt gemacht haben, â€“ besondere Formen, die sonst in der Metaphysik, auch bei Wolff, betrachtet sind. Man hebt z.B. heraus: Î±) daÃŸ Cartesius das Organische, die Tiere, als Maschinen angesehen habe, daÃŸ sie von einem Anderen bewegt werden, das selbsttÃ¤tige Prinzip des Denkens nicht in ihnen haben, â€“ eine mechanische Physiologie ein bestimmter, verstÃ¤ndiger Gedanke, der weiter von keiner Erheblichkeit. Bei dem scharfen Gegensatze des Denkens und der Ausdehnung ist jenes nicht betrachtet als Empfindung, so daÃŸ diese sich isolieren kann. Das Organische, als KÃ¶rper, muÃŸ sich auf Ausdehnung reduzieren. Das Weitere ist also AbhÃ¤ngigkeit von den ersten Bestimmungen. Î²) Die angeborenen Ideen nennt er die ewigen Wahrheiten; Locke und Leibniz stritten darÃ¼ber. Es ist krasser Ausdruck, nicht das Allgemeine wie bei Platon und SpÃ¤teren sondern das, was Evidenz, unmittelbare GewiÃŸheit hat; eine Vielheit des Denkens, mannigfaltige Begriffe in der Form eines Seins, natÃ¼rlich fest, wie GefÃ¼hle ins Herz gepflanzt, â€“ unmittelbare Vielheit, die im Denken selbst gegrÃ¼ndet ist. Î³) Das VerhÃ¤ltnis zwischen Seele und KÃ¶rper (sich selbst im Anderen, der Materie, setzen) ist nunmehr eine Hauptfrage, â€“ eben jene RÃ¼ckkehr des Gegenstandes in sich. In der Metaphysik finden sich viele Systeme darÃ¼ber. Das eine ist das des influxus physicus, daÃŸ der Geist sich auf kÃ¶rperliche Weise verhalte, daÃŸ der Gegenstand auf den Geist ein VerhÃ¤ltnis hÃ¤tte wie die KÃ¶rper gegeneinander; eine solche Vorstellung ist sehr roh. â€“ Wie faÃŸt Cartesius die Einheit von Seele und Leib? Die erste gehÃ¶rt dem Denken, der andere der Ausdehnung an: beide sind Substanz, keines bedarf des Begriffs des anderen; also ist Seele und Leib unabhÃ¤ngig voneinander. Sie kÃ¶nnen keinen direkten EinfluÃŸ aufeinander haben. Die Seele hat nur EinfluÃŸ, Wirksamkeit, insofern die Seele des KÃ¶rpers bedarf und umgekehrt, d.h. insofern sie wesentliche Beziehung aufeinander haben. Da aber jedes TotalitÃ¤t ist, so hat keines BedÃ¼rfnis des anderen und ebensowenig reale Beziehung darauf. Den physischen EinfluÃŸ beider hat Cartesius also konsequenterweise geleugnet; das ist mechanisches VerhÃ¤ltnis beider. Descartes hat das Spirituelle, Intellektuelle festgesetzt. In seinem cogito bin ich mir selbst zunÃ¤chst nur gewiÃŸ, ich kann abstrahieren von allem; darauf grÃ¼ndet er das Bestehen des Geistes fÃ¼r sich. Nun ist das Mittelding, die Verbindung anzugeben von dem Abstrakten und dem Ã„uÃŸerlichen, dem Einzelnen. Dies bestimmt nun Cartesius danach, daÃŸ er zwischen beiden setzt das, was den Grund ihrer VerÃ¤nderungen ausmacht, Gott als das Mittelglied der Verbindung. Ihre VerÃ¤nderungen korrespondieren miteinander: habe ich Triebe, Vorsatz, so wird er leiblich; dies Entsprechen ist bewirkt durch Gott. (Dies heiÃŸt man denn das systema assistentiae, es ist transzendent: Gott ist der metaphysische Grund ihrer gegenseitigen VerÃ¤nderungen, als er[156] der Seele in dem, was sie nicht durch ihre eigene Freiheit bewerkstelligen kann, Beistand leistet. Dies hat nachher Malebranche mehr ausgefÃ¼hrt. Das BedÃ¼rfnis, ein Vermittelndes zu haben, ist da; Gott wird nun gesetzt als solches.) Denn oben (S. 142 f.) sahen wir, Cartesius sagt von Gott, er ist eben die Wahrheit der Vorstellung. Insofern ich richtig, konsequent denke, so entspricht dem etwas Reales; der Zusammenhang davon ist Gott. Gott ist die vollkommene IdentitÃ¤t beider GegensÃ¤tze; da ist die Einheit der Idee, des Begriffs und des Realen. (Dies wird dann in der Spinozistischen Idee in seinen weiteren Momenten noch herausgehoben.) Das ist richtig; in den endlichen Dingen ist diese IdentitÃ¤t unvollkommen. Nur ist bei Cartesius diese Form unpassend; Î±) daÃŸ es zwei Dinge, Denken (Seele) und Leib, sind; Î²) Gott nun als ein drittes Ding erscheint, auÃŸerhalb beider, nicht der Begriff der Einheit und die beiden Glieder nicht selbst Begriff. Es muÃŸ aber nicht vergessen werden, daÃŸ er sagt, jene beiden ersten sind erschaffene Substanzen. Das gehÃ¶rt der Vorstellung an; Erschaffen ist kein bestimmter Gedanke. Diese ZurÃ¼ckfÃ¼hrung auf den Gedanken hat dann Spinoza gemacht.

> Diesen Mangel, die Kantische gedankenlose Inkonsequenz, durch die es dem ganzen System an spekulativer Einheit fehlt, hat Fichte aufgehoben. Die absolute Form ist es, die Fichte ergriffen, oder die absolute Form ist eben das absolute FÃ¼rsichsein, die absolute NegativitÃ¤t, nicht die Einzelheit, sondern der Begriff der Einzelheit und damit der Begriff der Wirklichkeit. Seine Philosophie ist Ausbildung der Form in sich (die Vernunft synthesiert sich in sich selbst, ist Synthese des Begriffs und der Wirklichkeit), und besonders eine konsequentere Darstellung der Kantischen Philosophie; sie geht Ã¼ber den Grundinhalt derselben nicht hinaus, und man hat sie besonders Wissenschaftslehre genannt. Seine ersten Schriften sind ganz Kantisch. Fichte hat auch seine Philosophie zunÃ¤chst fÃ¼r nichts anderes angesehen als fÃ¼r eine konsequente und systematische Vervollkommnung der Kantischen und Ich als deren absolutes Prinzip, so daÃŸ aus ihm, der zugleich unmittelbaren GewiÃŸheit seiner selbst, aller Inhalt des Universums als Produkt dargestellt werden mÃ¼sse, aufgestellt. Aber dies Prinzip hat er dann ebenso einseitig auf eine Seite gestellt: es ist von Haus aus subjektiv, mit einem Gegensatze behaftet; und die Realisierung desselben ist ein Fortlaufen all der Endlichkeit, ein aufs Vorhergehende ZurÃ¼cksehen.

> Das BedÃ¼rfnis der Philosophie ist dahin gesteigert, Î±) das absolute Wesen nicht mehr als die unmittelbare Substanz zu denken, welche den Unterschied, die RealitÃ¤t, Wirklichkeit nicht an ihr selbst hat. Gegen diese Substanz hat sich immer teils das SelbstbewuÃŸtsein gestrÃ¤ubt, das sein FÃ¼rsichsein darin nicht findet und das also seine Freiheit vermiÃŸte, -teils, dies Wesen gegenstÃ¤ndlich vorgestellt, ein selbstbewuÃŸtes, persÃ¶nliches Wesen forderte, teils ein lebendiges, selbstbewuÃŸtes, wirkliches, nicht in den abstrakten metaphysischen Gedanken allein eingeschlossenes. Î²) Wie das SelbstbewuÃŸtsein, so das BewuÃŸtsein, fÃ¼r welches Anderes ist. Dies forderte seinerseits das Moment der gegenstÃ¤ndlichen Wirklichkeit, das Sein als solches, in das der Gedanke Ã¼bergehen mÃ¼ÃŸte, die Wahrheit in dem gegenstÃ¤ndlichen Dasein, â€“ das Moment der Ã¤uÃŸeren Wirklichkeit, das wir bei den EnglÃ¤ndern besonders sahen. Dieser Begriff, der unmittelbar Wirklichkeit, und diese Wirklichkeit, die unmittelbar ihr Begriff ist, und zwar so, daÃŸ nicht ein dritter Gedanke Ã¼ber diese Einheit ist, noch daÃŸ es eine unmittelbare Einheit ist, welche den Unterschied, die Trennung nicht an ihr hÃ¤tte, ist Ich; es ist dies an ihm selbst Sich-Unterscheiden Entgegengesetzter. Wodurch es sich von der Einfachheit des Denkens unterscheidet und dies Andere unterscheidet, ist ebenso unmittelbar fÃ¼r es, ihm gleich oder nicht unterschieden. So ist es reines Denken; oder Ich ist das wahrhafte synthetische Urteil a priori, wie es Kant genannt hat.

> Dies Prinzip ist die begriffene Wirklichkeit; denn die Wirklichkeit ist eben das Anderssein fÃ¼r das BewuÃŸtsein, welches begriffen ist, das das SelbstbewuÃŸtsein in sich zurÃ¼ckgenommen hat. Und der Begriff des Begriffs ist von dieser Seite gefunden, daÃŸ in dem, was begriffen wird, das SelbstbewuÃŸtsein die GewiÃŸheit seiner selbst hat; was nicht begriffen ist, ist ihm ein Fremdes. â€“ Dieser absolute Begriff oder diese an und fÃ¼r sich selbst seiende Unendlichkeit ist es nun, welche in der Wissenschaft zu entwickeln ist und deren Unterscheidung als alle Unterscheidung des Universums aus sich darzustellen ist; in seinem Unterscheiden muÃŸ es in sich reflektiert bleiben, in gleicher Absolutheit. â€“ Es existiert Ã¼berall nichts weiter als das Ich; und Ich ist da, weil es da ist: was da ist, ist nur im Ich und fÃ¼r Ich. Fichte hat nun nur diesen Begriff aufgestellt; allein zur Wissenschaft, zur Realisierung aus sich selbst, hat er ihn nicht gebracht. Denn dieser Begriff fixiert sich ihm als dieser Begriff; er hat die Absolutheit fÃ¼r ihn, insofern er nur der nicht realisierte Begriff ist und also selbst der RealitÃ¤t wieder gegenÃ¼bertritt. Fichte hat damit die Natur der Realisierung und die Wissenschaft selbst nicht gefunden.

> {#FichteVorzugWissenschaft} Die Fichtesche Philosophie hat den groÃŸen Vorzug und das Wichtige, aufgestellt zu haben, daÃŸ Philosophie Wissenschaft aus hÃ¶chstem Grundsatz sein muÃŸ, woraus alle Bestimmungen notwendig abgeleitet sind. Das GroÃŸe ist die Einheit des Prinzips und der Versuch, wissenschaftlich konsequent den ganzen Inhalt des BewuÃŸtseins daraus zu entwickeln oder, wie man es nannte, die ganze Welt zu konstruieren. Man hat sich darÃ¼ber aufgehalten. Es ist BedÃ¼rfnis der Philosophie, eine lebendige Idee zu enthalten. Die Welt ist eine Blume, die aus einem Samenkorn ewig hervorgeht.

> Wie Kant das Erkennen, so stellt Fichte das Wissen auf. Fichte drÃ¼ckt die Aufgabe der Philosophie so aus, daÃŸ sie sei die Lehre von dem Wissen. Das BewuÃŸtsein weiÃŸ, das ist seine Natur; die philosophische Erkenntnis ist das Wissen dieses Wissens. Der Umfang des Wissens der ganzen Welt (was nicht fÃ¼r uns ist, geht uns nichts an) soll entwickelt werden; und ferner soll dieses Wissen Konsequenz der Entwicklung der Bestimmungen sein. Der Gegenstand der Philosophie ist Wissen; es ist ebenso Anfangspunkt, das allgemeine Wissen. Das ist Ich, es ist BewuÃŸtsein; das Ich ist Grund, Anfangspunkt. Fichte hat aber dies Prinzip nicht als Idee, sondern noch im BewuÃŸtsein Ã¼ber das, was wir als Wissen tun, aufgefaÃŸt und in der Gestalt der SubjektivitÃ¤t festgehalten. â€“ Â»Wissenschaft ist ein System der Erkenntnis durch einen obersten Grundsatz, welcher den Gehalt und die Form des Wissens ausdrÃ¼ckt. Wissenschaftslehre ist die Wissenschaft von dem Wissen, welche die MÃ¶glichkeit und GÃ¼ltigkeit alles Wissens darlegt und die MÃ¶glichkeit der GrundsÃ¤tze, der Form und dem Gehalte nach, die GrundsÃ¤tze selbst und dadurch den Zusammenhang alles menschlichen Wissens nachweist. Sie muÃŸ ein Prinzip haben, welches weder aus ihr bewiesen werden kann noch aus einer anderen Wissenschaft; denn sie ist die hÃ¶chste. Ist die Wissenschaftslehre, so gibt es auch ein System; gibt es ein System, so gibt es auch eine Wissenschaftslehre und einen absoluten ersten Grundsatz, â€“ durch einen unvermeidlichen Zirkel.Â«

> {#FichteIchDasErste} a) Wo Fichte in seiner Darstellung die hÃ¶chste Bestimmtheit erlangt hat, fÃ¤ngt er an von dem, was wir oben (S. 343 f., 346) gehabt haben, von der transzendentalen Einheit des SelbstbewuÃŸtseins; darin bin Ich eins, dies Ich, diese Einheit ist bei Fichte dieselbe und das Erste. Er geht in seiner Philosophie davon aus, daÃŸ die Philosophie mit einem schlechthin unbedingten, gewissen Grundsatz, mit etwas unbezweifelbar Gewissem in der gemeinen Erkenntnis, anfangen mÃ¼sse. Â»Beweisen oder bestimmen lÃ¤ÃŸt er sich nicht, wenn er absolut erster Grundsatz sein soll.Â« Von diesem Wissen ist nun die einfache Grundlage die GewiÃŸheit meiner selbst; diese GewiÃŸheit ist die Beziehung meiner auf mich selbst. Cartesius fing an: Cogito, ergo sum; ich denke, so bin ich. Das Sein des Ich ist nicht totes, sondern konkretes Sein, das hÃ¶chste Sein, das Denken. Denken ist TÃ¤tigkeit; diese als Eins, FÃ¼rsichseiendes vorgestellt, ist Ich. Ich ist das abstrakte Wissen, das Wissen Ã¼berhaupt; im Anfang haben wir nur das Ãœberhaupt. Dieses Wissen hat absolute GewiÃŸheit, wir fangen mit einem Gewissen an, Ich, â€“ derselbe Punkt wie bei Cartesius, aber mit ganz anderen BedÃ¼rfnissen und Forderungen. Denn aus diesem Ich soll nicht das Sein, sondern das weitere System des Denkens aufgestellt werden. 

> [[Descartes]] fÃ¤ngt mit dem Ich an; dann haben, finden wir noch andere Gedanken in uns, von Gott; dann kommt er zur Natur usf. Eine Philosophie ganz aus einem StÃ¼cke hat Fichte versucht, eine Philosophie, worin nichts Empirisches von auÃŸen aufgenommen wÃ¤re. â€“ Damit ist gleich ein schiefer Gesichtspunkt hereingebracht; und dieser Gedanke fÃ¤llt in die alte Vorstellung der Wissenschaft, von GrundsÃ¤tzen in dieser Form anzufangen und von ihnen auszugehen, so daÃŸ diesem Grundsatz die RealitÃ¤t, die aus ihm hergeleitet wird, gegenÃ¼bertritt und daher in Wahrheit Anderes ist, nicht abgeleitet wird. Oder jener Grundsatz drÃ¼ckt eben darum nur die absolute GewiÃŸheit seiner selbst, ohne die Wahrheit, aus.

> Der oberste Grundsatz ist unmittelbar, nicht abgeleitet; er soll fÃ¼r sich gewiÃŸ sein, das ist nur Ich. Ich soll an allem zweifeln, von allem abstrahieren; nur vom Ich kann ich nicht abstrahieren. Das Ich ist gewiÃŸ, die Philosophie will aber das Wahre. Das Gewisse ist das Subjektive, es soll der Grund bleiben; so bleibt das Weitere auch das Subjektive diese Form kann nicht weggebracht werden. Dieses Ich sahen wir auch bei Kant in der transzendentalen Apperzeption: Ich ist der Quell der Kategorien und Ideen, es ist das VerknÃ¼pfende. Alle Vorstellungen, Gedanken sind solche Synthesen, â€“ Mannigfaltiges durchs Denken synthesiert. Fichte geht nicht wie Kant erzÃ¤hlend zu Werke, indem er vom Ich beginnt; das ist das GroÃŸe an ihm. Aus dem Ich soll alles hergeleitet werden, das ErzÃ¤hlen soll aufgehoben werden. -Was in mir ist, das weiÃŸ ich; es ist das reine, abstrakte Wissen, dies ist Ich selbst. Hiervon fÃ¤ngt Fichte an. Kant nimmt die Bestimmungen des reinen Wissens, die Kategorien, empirisch auf aus der Logik, â€“ ein ganz unphilosophisches, unberechtigtes Verfahren. Fichte ist weitergegangen, und dies ist sein groÃŸes Verdienst; er hat gefordert und zu vollbringen gesucht die Ableitung, Konstruktion der Denkbestimmungen aus dem Ich. Ich ist denkend und tÃ¤tig, bringt seine Bestimmungen hervor. Wie und welche aber bringt es hervor? Ich ist BewuÃŸtsein, aber diese Notwendigkeit, daÃŸ ich Bestimmungen wie z.B. Ursache und Wirkung hervorbringe, geht jenseits meines BewuÃŸtseins vor; ich tue es aber, ich bringe die Kategorien instinktmÃ¤ÃŸig hervor.

> Die Philosophie bestimmt er nun als das kÃ¼nstliche BewuÃŸtsein, als das BewuÃŸtsein Ã¼ber das BewuÃŸtsein, so daÃŸ ich BewuÃŸtsein habe von dem, was mein BewuÃŸtsein tut. Man hat nun gesagt, man kÃ¶nne nicht hinter das BewuÃŸtsein kommen: ich habe BewuÃŸtsein, finde dies und jenes, finde die Bestimmung von Ursache und Wirkung usf. darin, finde das, was diese hervorgebracht haben; aber wie das BewuÃŸtsein diese Bestimmungen hervorgebracht hat, dahinter kann ich nicht kommen. Allein wenn ich Ã¼ber mein BewuÃŸtsein philosophiere, wenn ich weiÃŸ, was mein Ich tut, so komme ich hinter mein gewÃ¶hnliches BewuÃŸtsein. Wenn ich philosophiere, so bin ich BewuÃŸtsein und bin mir als BewuÃŸtsein Gegenstand; ich mache mir so mein gewÃ¶hnliches BewuÃŸtsein zum Gegenstand. Dies tut das gewÃ¶hnliche BewuÃŸtsein nicht; es beschÃ¤ftigt sich nur mit anderen GegenstÃ¤nden, Interessen usf., macht sich nicht sein eigenes BewuÃŸtsein zum Gegenstand. Philosophieren wir z.B. Ã¼ber Sein, Ursache Wirkung usf., so machen wir Sein usf. zu unserem BewuÃŸtsein. Mache ich so eine reine Kategorie zu meinem BewuÃŸtsein, so mache ich mein BewuÃŸt sein zum BewuÃŸtsein und stehe so hinter meinem gewÃ¶hnlichen BewuÃŸtsein. Fichte hat so das Wissen des Wissens erst zum BewuÃŸtsein gebracht.

> Das Weitere ist, daÃŸ also Fichte das philosophische BewuÃŸtsein, den Zweck der Philosophie darein gesetzt hat, das Wissen zu wissen; und er hat seine Philosophie deshalb Wissenschaftslehre genannt, die Wissenschaft des Wissens. Das Wissen ist hier die TÃ¤tigkeit, Wissen der Kategorien; diese hat Fichte betrachtet und konstruiert. Ich ist da Tatsache, sagte Fichte, das Erste. Ich ist noch nicht ein Satz. Als Satz, als Grundsatz muÃŸ Ich nicht als trockenes Ich, als Eins genommen werden; zum Satz gehÃ¶rt Synthese. â€“ Fichte analysiert Ich in drei GrundsÃ¤tze, aus welchen die ganze Wissenschaft entwickelt werden soll.

> Î±) Der erste Satz muÃŸ einfach sein; PrÃ¤dikat und Subjekt mÃ¼ssen sich gleich sein. Sind sie ungleich, so muÃŸ das Verbindende erst bewiesen werden; nach ihrer Verschiedenheit sind die Bestimmungen nicht unmittelbar eins, sie mÃ¼ssen also durch ein Drittes bewiesen werden. Der erste Grundsatz muÃŸ also identisch sein. â€“ Dieser erste Grundsatz nun nÃ¤her, als Grundsatz, unterscheidet die Form und den Gehalt an ihm; aber daÃŸ er unmittelbar wahr durch sich selbst sei, muÃŸ wieder Form und Gehalt dasselbe und er nach beiden unbedingt sein. Er heiÃŸt A = A, die abstrakte IdentitÃ¤t. Fichte erinnert selbst an Cogito, ergo sum. Â»Das Denken ist gar nicht das Wesen, sondern nur eine besondere Bestimmung des Seins; und es gibt auÃŸer jener noch manche andere Bestimmungen unseres Seins.Â« Â»Ich bemerke nur noch, daÃŸ man, wenn man Ich bin Ã¼berschreitet, notwendig auf den Spinozismus kommen muÃŸ.Â« Seine Einheit ist etwas, das durch uns hervorgebracht werden soll, aber nicht kann; sie ist nicht etwas, das ist.

> Der erste Satz ist nun: Ich bin mir selbst gleich, Ich = Ich, â€“ diese bestimmungslose IdentitÃ¤t. Das Subjekt und PrÃ¤dikat ist der Inhalt, und die Beziehung beider ist ebenso Ich; die Form ist die Beziehung, der Inhalt die beiden Seiten. Das Beziehende und das Bezogene muÃŸ dasselbe sein; der erste Grundsatz ist so Ich = Ich, das ist allerdings die Definition des Ich. Ich ist einfach; es ist nichts anderes als ein Beziehen des Ich auf Ich. Ich weiÃŸ von mir; sofern ich BewuÃŸtsein bin, weiÃŸ ich von einem Gegenstande; so weiÃŸ ich, daÃŸ er mein Gegenstand ist, â€“ der Gegenstand ist auch meiner. Der abstrakten Form nach ist dieser Satz Ich = Ich, die IdentitÃ¤t Ã¼berhaupt, Beziehung seiner auf sich selbst; zur Beziehung gehÃ¶ren zwei, die aber hier dasselbe sind. Ich ist identisch mit seinem Unterschiede, aber so, daÃŸ das Unterschiedene unmittelbar dasselbe ist und das Identische ebenso unterschieden ist; das ist Unterschied, der keiner ist. Das SelbstbewuÃŸtsein ist nicht tote IdentitÃ¤t, noch Nichtsein, sondern Gegenstand, der mir gleich ist. Ich ist Subjekt, PrÃ¤dikat und Beziehung. Abstrakt ist dies A = A, der Satz des Widerspruchs. A ist gleichgÃ¼ltiger Inhalt; Ich = Ich ist Einheit beider, Ich selbst. Das ist unmittelbar gewiÃŸ, alles andere muÃŸ mir ebenso gewiÃŸ werden; es soll Beziehung meiner auf mich sein. Der Inhalt soll in Ich verwandelt sein, so daÃŸ ich nur meine Bestimmung darin habe.
In diesem Grundsatze nun ist erstens noch kein Unterschied ausgedrÃ¼ckt; es ist wohl Subjekt und PrÃ¤dikat, aber fÃ¼r uns, die wir darÃ¼ber reflektieren und es unterscheiden, â€“ an ihm selbst ist kein Unterschied, kein wahrer Inhalt. Zweitens ist er wohl unmittelbar gewiÃŸ, GewiÃŸheit des SelbstbewuÃŸtseins; allein das SelbstbewuÃŸtsein ist ebenso BewuÃŸtsein, und darin ist es ihm ebenso gewiÃŸ, daÃŸ andere Dinge sind, â€“ es tritt diesen gegenÃ¼ber. Drittens hat er eben darum die Wahrheit nicht an ihm, weil die GewiÃŸheit seiner keine GegenstÃ¤ndlichkeit, nicht die Form des unterschiedenen Inhalts an ihr hat â€“ oder eben dem BewuÃŸtsein eines Anderen gegenÃ¼bertritt. â€“ Dieser Grundsatz ist abstrakt, es ist kein Unterschied darin; er hat nur formell einen Inhalt; er ist mangelhaft, weil er Inhalt enthalten soll. Wie kommt denn nun aber die Bestimmung hinein?

> Î²) Darum ist es fÃ¼r Fichte notwendig, einen zweiten Grundsatz zu setzen; es soll Inhalt, Unterschied vorkommen. Dieser Grundsatz ist der Form nach unbedingt; der Inhalt ist aber bedingt, er kommt dem Ich nicht zu. Der zweite Grundsatz, unter den ersten gesetzt, ist: Ich setze dem Ich ein Nicht-Ich entgegen, worin eben etwas anderes als das absolute SelbstbewuÃŸtsein gesetzt wird. Ihm gehÃ¶rt die Form darin an, die Beziehung; aber der Inhalt ist Nicht-Ich, anderer als Ich. Der Satz ist unabhÃ¤ngig danach- das Nicht-Ich, als Inhalt, vom Ich-, oder umgekehrt durch die Form der Entgegensetzung, die nicht aus dem Ersten abgeleitet werden kann; hier ist's denn schon mit dem Ableiten aus. Ich setze ein Anderes dem Ich gegenÃ¼ber, setze mich als nicht gesetzt; dies Nicht-Ich ist das Objekt Ã¼berhaupt, der Gegenstand, was gegen mich ist, das Negative meiner. Dieses Andere ist das Andere, Negative von Ich; es ist also ein sehr glÃ¼cklicher, guter und konsequenter Ausdruck, wenn Fichte es das Nicht-Ich nannte.

> Man hat vieles an dem Ich und Nicht-Ich lÃ¤cherlich finden wollen; es ist ein neues Wort, und darum kommt es uns Deutschen gleich kurios vor. Die Franzosen sagen Moi und Non-Moi, ohne zu lachen. Das Setzen in diesen Grundsatz gehÃ¶rt dem Ich an; das Nicht-Ich ist unabhÃ¤ngig vom Ich. Wir haben so zwei, â€“ Ich (SelbstbewuÃŸtsein), und darin beziehe ich mich auf ein Anderes. Die Form der Entgegensetzung kann nicht aus dem ersten Satz abgeleitet werden, ob gleich dieses doch gefordert war. Dieser zweite Satz heiÃŸt also: Ich setze mich als begrenzt, als Nicht-Ich. Fichte sagt, dieser zweite Satz ist auch absolut, wie der erste, nach einer Seite zwar bedingt durch den ersten, nÃ¤mlich daÃŸ das Nicht-Ich in mich aufgenommen ist, ich es mir entgegensetze, es ein Anderes meiner ist; aber das Negative darin ist etwas Absolutes. Dieser zweite Satz ist einerseits, weil Ich schon im ersten Satze war, bedingt; Nicht-Ich ist aber etwas Neues dazu. Wir haben also vor uns ein Feld, welches bloÃŸ vom Ich eingenommen ist; sodann habe ich vor mir als Gegenstand das Nicht-Ich.

> Î³) Zu diesen kommt noch ein dritter Satz, in welchem ich jetzt diese Verteilung in Ich und Nicht-Ich mache, die Synthesis beider, der Satz des Grundes, der dem Gehalte nach unbedingt ist, insofern der zweite der Form nach. Dieser dritte Satz ist nÃ¤mlich die Bestimmung jener beiden ersten SÃ¤tze durch einander, worin Ich das Nicht-Ich einschrÃ¤nkt. Â»Das Ich sowohl als das Nicht-Ich sind beide durch das Ich und im Ich gesetzt als durch einander gegenseitig beschrÃ¤nkbar, d. i. so, daÃŸ die RealitÃ¤t des einen die RealitÃ¤t des andern aufhebeÂ«, â€“ aber Â»nur zum TeilÂ«; nur so ist Synthesis, Deduktion mÃ¶glich. Ich schrÃ¤nke das Nicht-Ich ein, das Nicht-Ich ist fÃ¼r mich; Ich setze es in mich, in die Gleichheit meiner mit mir. So entnehme ich es der Ungleichheit, seinem Nicht-Ich- Sein: d.h. ich beschrÃ¤nke es. Diese BeschrÃ¤nkung des Nicht-Ich drÃ¼ckt Fichte so aus: Â»Ich setze im IchÂ«, und zwar Â»dem teilbaren Ich ein teilbares Nicht-Ich entgegenÂ«; eins ist durch das andere begrenzbar. Die ganze SphÃ¤re dessen, was ich vor mir habe, ist nicht Eins, sondern Zwei. Die SphÃ¤re soll Ich sein; ich setze sie aber teilbar, insofern Nicht-Ich darin ist. Und das Nicht-Ich hebe ich auch als ganze SphÃ¤re (nach dem zweiten Grundsatz) auf und setze es teilbar. Das ist der Satz des Grundes oder die Beziehung der RealitÃ¤t und Negation, die Grenze; das ist der synthetische Grundsatz, er enthÃ¤lt mich begrenzt durch Nicht-Ich und Nicht-Ich begrenzt durch Ich. Von dieser Synthese ist eigentlich in den beiden frÃ¼heren SÃ¤tzen noch nichts enthalten. So ist auch hier derselbe Dualismus wie bei Kant, wenn es auch nur zwei Akte des Ich sind und wenn wir auch ganz im Ich stehenbleiben. Die mannigfaltigen VerhÃ¤ltnisse von Ich und Nicht-Ich geben nun die Kategorien, wie SubstantialitÃ¤t, KausalitÃ¤t usw. â€“ Schon diese erste Aufstellung dreier GrundsÃ¤tze hebt die wissenschaftliche Immanenz auf.

> Diese Begrenzung kann nun auf zweierlei Weise fÃ¼r mich sein. In der Grenze wird beides negiert: das eine Mal ist das eine passiv, das andere Mal das andere. In dieser Begrenzung setzt Î±) Ich das eine Mal das Nicht-Ich als begrenzend und sich als begrenzt, worin das Ich sich setzt als einen Gegenstand nÃ¶tig habend: Ich weiÃŸ mich als Ich, aber bestimmt vom Nicht-Ich; Nicht-Ich ist hier tÃ¤tig, Ich passiv. Dann Î²) umgekehrt: Ich bin das BeschrÃ¤nkende, das Anderssein aufhebend, Nicht-Ich das BeschrÃ¤nkte; Ich weiÃŸ mich als schlechthin bestimmend das Nicht-Ich, Ich ist die absolute Ursache des Nicht-Ich als solchen. Das erste ist der Satz der theoretischen Vernunft, der Intelligenz, â€“ das zweite der Satz der praktischen Vernunft, des Willens. Willen ist es, daÃŸ ich meiner mir bewuÃŸt bin als den Gegenstand begrenzend; so mache ich mich tÃ¤tig auf den Gegenstand. Der theoretische Satz ist, daÃŸ ich mir Gegenstand bin, so daÃŸ ich vom Nicht-Ich begrenzt werde. Wir sagen, der Gegenstand ist vor mir, er bestimmt mich; zwischen beiden ist ein VerhÃ¤ltnis, sie begrenzen einander. Einmal begrenze ich, und das andere Mal werde ich begrenzt von dem Nicht-Ich, â€“ dies ist das Theoretische, daÃŸ Ich, indem ich anschaue, ein Inhalt ist; und ich werde so bestimmt, ich habe diesen Inhalt in mir, eben den Inhalt, der auÃŸer mir so ist. Dies ist im ganzen ebenso wie bei der Erfahrung Kants: Ich, und ein Stoff, Inhalt; so ist hier ein Nicht-Ich, wodurch das Ich bestimmt wird. Ich ist einmal bestimmt, das andere Mal, indem es sich erhÃ¤lt, auch bestimmend; denn es ist denkend.

> Hier vorzÃ¼glich ist es nun, daÃŸ man [von] Fichte erwartet, die RÃ¼ckkehr des Andersseins in das absolute SelbstbewuÃŸtsein aufzuzeigen. Allein, indem einmal das Anderssein als unbedingt, an sich angenommen worden, so kommt diese RÃ¼ckkehr nicht zustande. Das Jenseits des Ich soll vom praktischen[398] Ich bestimmt werden; so bleibt dem unbestimmten Nicht-Ich nur der AnstoÃŸ auf Ich Ã¼brig. So findet die ins Unendliche gehende TÃ¤tigkeit einen AnstoÃŸ, durch den sie zurÃ¼ckgedrÃ¤ngt wird in sich, gegen den sie dann aber wieder reagiert. Indem ich nun das Nicht-Ich setze, muÃŸ das affirmative Ich sich selbst beschrÃ¤nken. Diesen Widerspruch sucht Fichte zu vereinigen, aber dessenungeachtet lÃ¤ÃŸt er den Grundschaden des Dualismus bestehen; so ist er nicht aufgelÃ¶st, und das Letzte ist nur ein Sollen, Bestreben, Sehnen. Diese unendliche Sehnsucht hat man dann im SchÃ¶nen und im religiÃ¶sen GefÃ¼hl als das HÃ¶chste angesehen und damit zusammenhÃ¤ngend die oben (18, S. 459 ff.) erwÃ¤hnte Ironie. â€“ Dies Ich ist in dieser RÃ¼ckkehr nur ein Sehnen, Streben; es ist seinerseits fixiert und kann sein Streben nicht realisieren. Es bestimmt wohl das Andere, aber diese Einheit ist schlechthin eine endliche; Nicht-Ich ist unmittelbar dem Bestimmen wieder so entgangen und aus dieser Einheit getreten. â€“ Was vorhanden ist, ist nur eine Abwechslung des SelbstbewuÃŸtseins und des BewuÃŸtseins eines Anderen und das unendliche Fortgehen dieses Abwechselns, das kein Ende findet.

> b) Im theoretischen BewuÃŸtsein weiÃŸ ich mich als bestimmt von dem Gegenstande; das Ich ist das Setzende Ã¼berhaupt, findet sich darin durch das Nicht-Ich beschrÃ¤nkt. Es ist sich aber selbst gleich; seine unendliche TÃ¤tigkeit geht daher darauf, das Nicht-Ich immer aufzuheben, sich selbst hervorzubringen. Die Weisen, daÃŸ das Ich sich selbst setzt, sind die verschiedenen Weisen seiner TÃ¤tigkeit; diese haben wir in ihrer Notwendigkeit zu erkennen. Das ist die philosophische Erkenntnis; so erkenne ich immer nur Wissen, Tat des Ich. Es ist ans BewuÃŸtsein appelliert: Ich und Nicht-Ich werden in ihrer Abstraktion postuliert. Die philosophische Erkenntnis betrachtet aber das BewuÃŸtsein selbst. Es ist nicht genug, daÃŸ wir dieses im BewuÃŸtsein finden; das BewuÃŸtsein des[399] BewuÃŸtseins ist, daÃŸ die TÃ¤tigkeiten mit BewuÃŸtsein produziert werden, welche das gemeine BewuÃŸtsein auch produziert, aber ohne es zu wissen. Im gewÃ¶hnlichen BewuÃŸtsein weiÃŸ ich nicht, daÃŸ ich mich darin auch tÃ¤tig, bestimmend verhalte; dies weiÃŸ nur das philosophische BewuÃŸtsein. Ein Gegenstand ist viereckig, ich stelle ihn groÃŸ vor usw. Meinem gewÃ¶hnlichen BewuÃŸtsein sind diese Bestimmungen gegeben; ich nehme sie, daÃŸ sie an mich kommen, â€“ der Gegenstand ist. Das, was ich aber vor mir habe, das tue ich selbst; das weiÃŸ das gemeine BewuÃŸtsein nicht, das philosophische BewuÃŸtsein erkennt dies. Wenn ich die Wand sehe, so denke ich nicht ans Sehen, sondern an die Wand; das Sehen ist aber meine TÃ¤tigkeit. Ich empfinde, das ist nur ein durch mich Gesetztes; dieses Setzen erkenne ich im philosophischen BewuÃŸtsein, diese Bestimmungen sind also durch mich gesetzt. â€“ Das Ich als theoretisch ist tÃ¤tig, es setzt sich aber hier als beschrÃ¤nkt, der Gegenstand hat Einwirkung auf mich; das nennt Fichte das philosophische BewuÃŸtsein. Es weiÃŸ, daÃŸ Ich das Setzende ist; es setzt hier, daÃŸ das Nicht-Ich etwas in mir setzt. Das Ich setzt sich als Begrenztwerden vom Nicht-Ich, aber ich mache diese BeschrÃ¤nkung zur meinigen; so ist sie fÃ¼r mich in mir, diese PassivitÃ¤t des Ich ist selbst die TÃ¤tigkeit des Ich.

> Diese Begrenzung beider wird nun fortgefÃ¼hrt. Die theoretische Seite ist das Ich, welches alle Bestimmungen der Vorstellung, des Denkens hervorbringt, aber bewuÃŸtlos; das BeschrÃ¤nktwerden schwebt dem gemeinen BewuÃŸtsein allein vor; daÃŸ ich dies setze, erkennt allein das philosophische BewuÃŸtsein. Ich setzt sich so, oder es ist ein Bestimmen des Ich selbst; d.h. alle RealitÃ¤t, die im Gegenstande fÃ¼r Ich erscheint, ist eine Bestimmung des Ich, â€“ wie bei Kant die Kategorien und sonstigen Bestimmungen. Die Entwicklung der theoretischen Vernunft ist Entwicklung dieser Schranke; diese TÃ¤tigkeit ist nun die Kategorie. Fichte will die Formen dieser Begrenzung durchgehen; hieraus entwickelt er die Bestimmungen des Gegenstandes, und diese Bestimmungen[400] nennt er Kategorien. Und nÃ¤her sucht Fichte null die besonderen Kategorien daraus abzuleiten; woran von Aristoteles an kein Mensch gedacht hat â€“ die Denkbestimmungen in ihrer Notwendigkeit, ihrer Ableitung, ihrer Konstruktion aufzuzeigen â€“, dies hat Fichte versucht. Aber von Hause aus ist seine Darstellung mit einem Gegensatze behaftet wie bei Kant: Ich und die Vorstellung, und dann die Dinge an sich; hier bei Fichte das Ich und das Nicht-Ich. Es ist ein AnstoÃŸ; alle Formen, worunter er mir vorkommt, daÃŸ das Objekt Substanz sei usw., ist ein Gesetztwerden durch mich, z.B. Wechselbestimmung im dritten Satze. Durch die Bestimmung der RealitÃ¤t oder Negation des Ich wird zugleich die Negation oder RealitÃ¤t des Nicht-Ich bestimmt; beides in einem ist Wechselbestimmung. Gleicher Grad der TÃ¤tigkeit des einen als Leiden im andern ist KausalitÃ¤t. Ich und Nicht-Ich sind bezogen und durch einander begrenzt; insofern etwas als RealitÃ¤t des Nicht-Ich betrachtet wird, werde Ich insofern als passiv betrachtet. Und umgekehrt: insofern Ich real, tÃ¤tig bin, das Objekt leidend, ist das entgegengesetzte VerhÃ¤ltnis vorhanden. Dieses VerhÃ¤ltnis, daÃŸ die PassivitÃ¤t der Objekte meine AktivitÃ¤t oder RealitÃ¤t ist und umgekehrt, ist der Begriff der KausalitÃ¤t. Es ist Weise des Begrenzens, nÃ¤here Weise des VerhÃ¤ltnisses. Â»So viele Teile der Negation das Ich in sich setzt, so viele Teile der RealitÃ¤t setzt es in das Nicht-Ich... Es setzt sich demnach sich bestimmend, insofern es bestimmt wird, und bestimmt werdend, insofern es sich bestimmt.Â« Das ist der erste vernÃ¼nftige Versuch in der Welt, die Kategorien abzuleiten; dieser Fortgang von einer Bestimmtheit zu einer anderen ist Analyse vom Standpunkte des BewuÃŸtseins aus, nicht an und fÃ¼r sich.

> Ich ist insofern der Idealgrund aller Vorstellungen des Gegenstandes; alles Bestimmtsein des Gegenstands ist eine Bestimmung des Ich. Aber daÃŸ er Gegenstand sei, muÃŸ er dem Ich entgegengesetzt sein, â€“ die durch Ich gesetzten Bestimmungen als ein Anderes, Nicht-Ich. Diese Entgegensetzung des Gegenstands ist der Realgrund der Vorstellungen, Ich ist auch Realgrund des Gegenstands; denn es ist ebenso ein Bestimmen des Ich, daÃŸ Nicht-Ich als Objekt dem Ich entgegengesetzt sei. Beides, der Realgrund des Vorstellens und der Idealgrund sind ein und dasselbe; in jenem Sinne ist Ich tÃ¤tig und Nicht-Ich rein passiv, nach der andern Seite ist Ich passiv und der Gegenstand tÃ¤tig, einwirkend. Ich hat aber im nicht philosophischen BewuÃŸtsein nicht das BewuÃŸtsein seiner TÃ¤tigkeit im Vorstellen des Gegenstandes, sondern stellt sich seine eigene TÃ¤tigkeit als TÃ¤tigkeit des Nicht-Ich vor. â€“ Wir sehen hier den Gegensatz verschiedene Gestalten annehmen: Ich, Nicht-Ich; Setzen und Entgegensetzen; zweierlei TÃ¤tigkeiten; Vorstellen des Nicht-Ich, seiner eigenen TÃ¤tigkeit des Entgegensetzens als eines Fremden.

> Ich soll nun das Idealprinzip und das Nicht-Ich das Realprinzip sein, worÃ¼ber Herr Krug viel geschwatzt hat; wie es denn damals in Deutschland viele Philosophien gegeben hat, wie Krugsche, Friessche, Bouterweksche, Schulzesche usf. Philosophie, â€“ ein Gebraue aus aufgerafften Gedanken und Vorstellungen, Tatsachen, die ich in mir finde. Ihre Gedanken sind aber alle aus Fichte, Kant oder Schelling genommen, soweit Gedanken Ã¼berhaupt darin sind, oder es ist ein ModifikatiÃ¶nchen angebracht, und diese sind grÃ¶ÃŸtenteils nichts anderes, als daÃŸ die groÃŸen Prinzipien dÃ¼rftig gemacht, die lebendigen Punkte getÃ¶tet sind; oder es sind untergeordnete Formen verÃ¤ndert, wodurch denn ein anderes Prinzip aufgestellt werden soll, aber nÃ¤her betrachtet bleiben es die Prinzipien einer jener Philosophien. Es mag dies als Trost dienen, daÃŸ ich von allen diesen Philosophien nicht weiter spreche; das Auseinanderlegen derselben wÃ¤re[402] nichts als ein Aufzeigen, daÃŸ alles aus Kant, Fichte oder Schelling genommen ist und daÃŸ die Modifikation der Formen nur ist der Schein einer VerÃ¤nderung, eigentlich aber eine Verschlechterung der Prinzipien dieser Philosophen.
Beim Idealprinzip der Fichteschen Philosophie bin Ich also das Bestimmende, Setzende. Aber es ist in diesem Bestimmen auch ein Negatives vorhanden; Ich finde mich bestimmt, und Ich ist sich selbst gleich, ist unendlich, d.h. identisch mit sich. Schranke der menschlichen Vernunft usf. ist eine unnÃ¼tze Redensart. DaÃŸ die Vernunft des Subjekts beschrÃ¤nkt ist, versteht sich von selbst; aber wenn wir vom Denken sprechen, so ist Unendlichkeit nichts anderes als Sich-zu-sich-selbst-Verhalten, nicht zu seiner Grenze: der Ort, wo der Mensch unendlich ist, ist eben im Denken. Die Unendlichkeit kann dann auch sehr abstrakt sein, und so ist sie auch wieder endlich; aber dessenungeachtet bleibt die Unendlichkeit in sich selbst. Fichte sagt nun, Ich ist unendlich, ist denkend, findet sich aber mit einem Nicht-Ich; dies ist ein Widerspruch. Das Ich, das schlechthin bei sich selbst sein soll, soll nun bei anderem sein, â€“ das Ich, das schlechthin frei ist. Die Forderung, diesen Widerspruch aufzulÃ¶sen, hat nun bei Fichte die Stellung, daÃŸ sie nur eine geforderte AuflÃ¶sung ist, daÃŸ ich die Schranke immerfort aufzuheben, Ã¼ber die Grenze immer fortzugehen habe ins Unendliche, in die schlechte Unendlichkeit hinaus, und immer eine neue Grenze finde. Mit dem Aufheben einer Grenze zeigt sich immer eine neue; es ist eine fortgesetzte Abwechslung von Negation und Affirmation, eine IdentitÃ¤t mit sich, die wieder in die Negation verfÃ¤llt und daraus immer wieder hergestellt wird. â€“ Dies ist der Standpunkt Fichtes in RÃ¼cksicht des Theoretischen.

Ebenso deduziert Fichte nun das Vorstellen. Ich bin tÃ¤tig, gehe hinaus; Ich findet sich aber in seiner TÃ¤tigkeit gehemmt, findet eine Grenze, geht in sich zurÃ¼ck. Das sind zwei entgegengesetzte[403] Richtungen, Hinaus und Hinein, beide sind in mir; ich schwebe zwischen beiden, will sie vereinigen, so bin ich Einbildungskraft. DaÃŸ Bestimmung, Grenze, Festes zwischen beiden sei, muÃŸ ich die Grenze stÃ¤ndig machen; das ist der Verstand. Bestimmungen des Verstandes, der Objekte (Kategorien) und Bestimmungen der Vorstellung sind Weisen der Synthese; jede Synthese ist aber neuer Widerspruch. Es sind also neue Vermittlungen nÃ¶tig; diese sind neue Bestimmungen.
So sagt Fichte: Ich kann das Nicht-Ich immer fort bestimmen, zu meiner Vorstellung machen, d.h. ihm seine Negation gegen mich nehmen; ich habe es nur mit meiner TÃ¤tigkeit zu tun. Es ist aber immer noch Ã„uÃŸerlichkeit darin vorhanden, diese bleibt zurÃ¼ck, wird nicht erklÃ¤rt durch meine TÃ¤tigkeit. Dieses Jenseits nennt Fichte den unendlichen AnstoÃŸ. Ich ist in seiner Selbstbestimmung als bestimmend und bestimmt zugleich betrachtet worden; wird Â»darauf reflektiert, daÃŸ das das schlechthin Bestimmte Bestimmende ein schlechthin Unbestimmtes sein mÃ¼sse, ferner darauf, daÃŸ Ich und Nicht-Ich schlechthin entgegengesetzt sindÂ«, so ist das eine Mal Ich das Unbestimmte, das andere Mal Nicht-Ich. Ich macht das Objekt zu seiner Vorstellung, negiert es; so ist diese Philosophie Idealismus, alle Bestimmungen des Gegenstandes sind ideelle. Alles, was Ich Bestimmtes hat, hat es durch mein Setzen: Ich mache einen Rock, Stiefel selbst, indem Ich sie anlege. Es bleibt zurÃ¼ck nur der leere AnstoÃŸ; das ist das Kantische Ding an sich. Das Ich, die theoretische Vernunft, setzt ihr Bestimmen ins Unendliche fort. â€ºIch bleibt aber immer, als Intelligenz Ã¼berhaupt, abhÃ¤ngig von einem unbestimmten Nicht-Ich; nur durch solches ist es Intelligenz.â€¹ Das Theoretische ist so abhÃ¤ngig.

> Die Form der Darstellung hat Unbequemlichkeit; Ich setzt, so habe ich immer Ich vor Augen. Da erscheint mir immer mein empirisches Ich; das ist ungereimt. Die theoretische TÃ¤tigkeit ist bewuÃŸtlos; sie erscheint erst im philosophischen Erkennen als bewuÃŸt; im gemeinen BewuÃŸtsein sind mir meine Produkte Gegebenes. Das Ich ist auch ungeschickte, Ã¼berflÃ¼ssige Form, die den Gesichtspunkt verrÃ¼ckt. DaÃŸ ich vorstelle, ist allerdings meine TÃ¤tigkeit; der Inhalt ist aber die Hauptsache, es handelt sich um den Inhalt des Setzens und seinen notwendigen Zusammenhang durch ihn selbst. BeschÃ¤ftigt man sich nur mit dem Inhalt, so verschwindet diese Form der SubjektivitÃ¤t, welche das Herrschende ist; die subjektive Form ist das Bleibende in seinem Gegensatze. FÃ¼r das Ich bleibt immer das Ding-an-sich; der Dualismus lÃ¶st sich nicht auf. Man hat es nicht mit dem Wahren an und fÃ¼r sich zu tun, sondern mit einem AbhÃ¤ngigen, weil Ich beschrÃ¤nkt, nicht absolut ist, wie es sein Begriff fordert. Die Intelligenz wird hier nicht als Geist betrachtet, er ist frei; Ich kommt nicht weiter, hat es immer mit demselben unendlichen AnstoÃŸ zu tun.

> c) Das Zweite ist die praktische Vernunft. Im Praktischen aber ist es, wo dieser Gegensatz sich auflÃ¶sen soll. Das VerhÃ¤ltnis des praktischen Ich ist, daÃŸ es sich selbst setzt als bestimmend das Nicht-Ich, â€“ Ich bei mir selbst darin sei. Ich ist unendliche TÃ¤tigkeit, Ich = Ich ist absolut, â€“ freilich abstrakt. Aber um eine Bestimmung zu haben, muÃŸ doch ein Nicht-Ich sein; Ich ist die TÃ¤tigkeit, KausalitÃ¤t, das Setzende des Nicht-Ich und das Aufhebende des Gegensatzes desselben. â€“ Aber wie bei Kant Sinnlichkeit und Vernunft entgegengesetzt bleibt, so ist derselbe Gegensatz hier, nur in abstrakterer Form, nicht in der roh empirischen Kants. Fichte windet sich hier auf mannigfaltige Weise oder gibt dem Gegensatze mancherlei verschiedene Formen; die schlechteste Form ist, daÃŸ Ich als KausalitÃ¤t gesetzt ist; denn darin[405] hat es ein Anderes notwendig, worauf es tÃ¤tig ist. Â»Das absolute Ich soll demnach sein Ursache des Nicht-Ich,... d. i. nur desjenigen im Nicht-Ich, was Ã¼brigbleibt, wenn man von allen erweisbaren Formen der Vorstellung abstrahiert; desjenigen, welchem der AnstoÃŸ auf die ins Unendliche hinausgehende TÃ¤tigkeit des Ich zugeschrieben wird; denn daÃŸ von den besonderen Bestimmungen des Vorgestellten, als eines solchen, das intelligente Ich nach den notwendigen Gesetzen des Vorstellens Ursache sei, wird in der theoretischen Wissenschaftslehre dargetan.Â« Die Schranke der Intelligenz soll durchbrochen werden; das Ich soll das allein TÃ¤tige sein. Das Andere, der unendliche AnstoÃŸ, soll aufgehoben werden; Ich soll mich befreien.
Â»Nun sollte in unserer Voraussetzung das Ich ein Nicht-Ich setzen schlechthin und ohne allen Grund, d. i. es sollte sich selbst schlechthin und ohne allen Grund einschrÃ¤nken, zum Teil nicht setzen.Â« Dies tut es ja schon als intelligent. Â»Es mÃ¼ÃŸte demnach den Grund, sich nicht zu setzen, in sich selbst habenÂ«; Ich ist aber gleich Ich, setzt sich selbst, â€“ Â»es mÃ¼ÃŸte in ihm sein das Prinzip, sich zu setzen, und das Prinzip, sich auch nicht zu setzen. Mithin wÃ¤re das Ich in seinem Wesen sich selbst entgegengesetzt und widerstreitend; es wÃ¤re in ihm ein zwiefaches, entgegengesetztes Prinzip, welche Annahme sich selbst widerspricht, denn dann wÃ¤re in ihm gar kein Prinzip. Das Ich wÃ¤re gar nichts, denn es hÃ¶be sich selbst auf.Â« Â»Alle WidersprÃ¼che werden vereinigt durch nÃ¤here Bestimmung der widersprechenden SÃ¤tze... In einem anderen Sinne mÃ¼ÃŸte das Ich gesetzt sein als unendlich, in einem anderen als endlich. WÃ¤re es in einem und demselben Sinne als unendlich und als endlich gesetzt, so wÃ¤re der Widerspruch unauflÃ¶sbar; das Ich wÃ¤re nicht Eins, sondern Zwei... Insofern das Ich sich als unendlich setzt geht seine TÃ¤tigkeit auf das Ich selbst und auf nichts anderes[406] als das Ich... Insofern das Ich Schranken und sich selbst in diese Schranken setzt, geht seine TÃ¤tigkeit nicht unmittelbar auf sich selbst, sondern auf ein entgegenzusetzendes Nicht-IchÂ«, auf ein Anderes, ein Objekt, ist Â»objektive TÃ¤tigkeit.Â« So bleibt Fichte beim Gegensatz, nur hat er andere Gestalt als zwei Richtungen im Ich; beide sollen eine und dieselbe TÃ¤tigkeit des Ich sein. Ich soll darauf gehen, das Entgegengesetzte, das Nicht-Ich, meiner Freiheit gemÃ¤ÃŸ zu bestimmen; jenseits meiner Bestimmung kommt aber dasselbe Nicht-Ich immer wieder vor. Das Ich setzt schlechthin einen Gegenstand, Grenzpunkt; aber wo die Grenze sei, ist unbestimmt. Den Kreis meiner Bestimmung kann ich ins Unendliche hinaus verlegen, erweitern; aber ein Jenseits bleibt immer.

> Das Letzte in Ansehung des Praktischen ist so, daÃŸ die TÃ¤tigkeit des Ich ein Sehnen, Streben ist, â€“ dasselbe, was das Kantische Sollen; Fichte behandelt dies mit groÃŸer Weitschweifigkeit. Die Fichtesche Philosophie hat denselben Standpunkt als die Kantische Philosophie; das Letzte ist immer die SubjektivitÃ¤t, sie ist an und fÃ¼r sich seiend. Sehnen ist das GÃ¶ttliche; im Sehnen habe ich mich nicht vergessen; darum ist es ein so behaglicher Zustand, Ich sei diese Vortrefflichkeit. Streben ist ein unvollendetes Tun oder an sich begrenztes Tun. Das Praktische als ein solches ist mit einem Gegensatze behaftet, negativ gegen ein Anderes. Dies Nicht-Ich, worauf es tÃ¤tig ist, hat zwar alle Bestimmungen durch die TÃ¤tigkeit des Ich; aber es bleibt ihm das reine Jenseits Ã¼brig, es ist ein unendlicher AnstoÃŸ: es hat nur die Bedeutung von Nicht-Ich, keine positive, an sich selbst seiende Bestimmung.

> Das letzte Resultat ist ein nie aufzulÃ¶sender Zirkel, daÃŸ nÃ¤mlich Â»der endliche Geist notwendig etwas Absolutes auÃŸer sich setzen muÃŸ (ein Ding an sich) und dennoch von[407] der andern Seite anerkennen muÃŸ, daÃŸ dasselbe nur fÃ¼r ihn dasei (ein notwendiges Noumen)Â«. Oder wir sehen Ich schlechthin bestimmt nur im Gegensatze, Ich nur als BewuÃŸtsein und SelbstbewuÃŸtsein, das nicht darÃ¼ber hinauskommt, noch zum Geiste wird. Ich ist der absolute Begriff, der nicht zur Einheit des Denkens kommt, nicht in diese Einfachheit zurÃ¼ckkehrt oder in der Einfachheit nicht den Unterschied, in der Bewegung nicht die Ruhe hat, â€“ Setzen, reine TÃ¤tigkeit des Ich und Entgegensetzen nicht als dasselbe begreift. Oder Ich begreift den unendlichen AnstoÃŸ, das Nicht-Ich nicht; es bestimmt das Nicht-Ich, aber es bleibt ein Jenseits â€“ ein Jenseits, welches als Nicht-Ich das SelbstbewuÃŸtsein Nicht sich zu eigen zu machen weiÃŸ.

> Î±) Erstens behÃ¤lt dadurch Ich die Bedeutung des einzelnen wirklichen SelbstbewuÃŸtseins, entgegengesetzt dem allgemeinen, absoluten, oder dem Geiste, worin es selbst nur Moment ist; denn das einzelne SelbstbewuÃŸtsein ist eben dieses, das gegen ein Anderes auf der Seite stehenbleibt. Wenn Ich deswegen das absolute Wesen genannt wurde, so gab dies das ungeheure; Ã„rgernis, weil Ich in der Tat bestimmt nur in dem Sinne des einzelnen SelbstbewuÃŸtseins oder des Subjekts, entgegengesetzt dem Allgemeinen, vorkommt.

> Î²) Zweitens kommt Fichte nicht zur Idee der Vernunft, als der vollendeten, realen Einheit des Subjekts und Objekts, oder des Ich und Nicht-Ich; sie ist ein Sollen, wie bei Kant ein Ziel, ein Glauben, daÃŸ beides an sich eins sei, aber ein Ziel, dessen Erreichung derselbe Widerspruch wie bei Kant ist, nicht die gegenwÃ¤rtige Wirklichkeit an ihm hat. Fichte bleibt beim Sollen stehen; jedoch wie Kant den Gedanken einer Vereinigung in einem Glauben hinstellt, so schlieÃŸt auch Fichte mit einem Glauben. Das hat er in populÃ¤ren Schriften ausgefÃ¼hrt. â€“ Weil nÃ¤mlich Ich fixiert ist als entgegengesetzt gegen Nicht-Ich und nur ist als entgegengesetzt,[408] so geht es in jener Einheit verloren; â€“ die Erreichung dieses Ziels ist deswegen in das schlechte, sinnliche Unendliche hinausgeschoben, eben ein Fortgang ohne Gegenwart, ohne Wirklichkeit an ihm selbst, denn Ich hat nur in seinem Gegensatze alle Wirklichkeit. â€“ Die Fichtesche Philosophie erkennt nur den endlichen Geist, nicht den unendlichen, nicht als allgemeines Denken, wie die Kantische das Nichtwahre; oder sie ist formell. Das Wissen von der absoluten Einheit wird als Glaube an eine moralische Weltordnung gefaÃŸt; sie ist absolute Voraussetzung; wir haben Glauben bei allem, was Ich tue, daÃŸ jede moralische Handlung einen guten Erfolg haben werde. Diese Idee ist wie bei Kant ein Allgemeines, ein Gedankending. Â»In Summa: dadurch, daÃŸ etwas begriffen wird, hÃ¶rt es auf, Gott zu sein; und jeder vorgebliche Begriff von Gott ist notwendig der eines Abgotts... Religion ist ein praktischer Glaube an die moralische WeltordnungÂ« (Gott); Â»Glaube an eine Ã¼bersinnliche Welt gehÃ¶rt nach unserer Philosophie unter die unmittelbaren Wahrheiten.Â« Fichte schlieÃŸt so mit der hÃ¶chsten Idee, Vereinigung der Freiheit und Natur, so daÃŸ sie unmittelbar nicht erkannte ist; nur der Gegensatz fÃ¤llt ins BewuÃŸtsein. Diese geglaubte Vereinigung findet er auch in Liebe Gottes. Als geglaubt, empfunden, gehÃ¶rt diese Form der ReligiositÃ¤t an, nicht der Philosophie; und nur dies in der Philosophie zu erkennen, kann Interesse haben.

> Es bleibt bei einer vÃ¶llig ungenÃ¼genden Ã„uÃŸerlichkeit: weil eine Bestimmtheit notwendig, so die andere; â€“ die Nicht-Idee liegt zugrunde. Ich ist auf ein Anderes bezogen, wieder auf ein Anderes usf. ins Unendliche. Â»Die Wissenschaftslehre ist realistisch. Sie zeigt, daÃŸ das BewuÃŸtsein endlicher Naturen sich schlechterdings nicht erklÃ¤ren lasse, wenn man nicht eine unabhÃ¤ngig von denselben vorhandene, ihnen[409] vÃ¶llig entgegengesetzte Kraft annimmt, von der dieselben ihrem empirischen Dasein nach selbst abhÃ¤ngig sind. Sie behauptet aber auch nichts weiter als eine solche entgegengesetzte Kraft, die von den endlichen Wesen bloÃŸ gefÃ¼hlt, aber nicht erkannt wird. Alle mÃ¶glichen Bestimmungen dieser Kraft oder dieses Nicht-Ich, die in die Unendlichkeit hinaus in unserem BewuÃŸtsein vorkommen kÃ¶nnen, macht sie sich anheischig, aus dem bestimmenden VermÃ¶gen des Ich abzuleiten, und muÃŸ dieselben, so gewiÃŸ sie Wissenschaftslehre ist, wirklich ableiten kÃ¶nnen.Â« Diese Wissenschaft ist aber nicht transzendent, sondern transzendental. Â»Sie erklÃ¤rt allerdings alles BewuÃŸtsein aus einem unabhÃ¤ngig von allem BewuÃŸtsein Vorhandenen; aber sie vergiÃŸt nicht,... daÃŸ jenes UnabhÃ¤ngige abermals ein Produkt ihrer eigenen Denkkraft wird, mithin etwas vom Ich AbhÃ¤ngiges ist, in sofern es fÃ¼r das Ich dasein soll.Â« Alles ist seiner IdealitÃ¤t nach vom Ich abhÃ¤ngig; Ich aber ist, seiner RealitÃ¤t nach, selbst abhÃ¤ngig. Dies notwendige AuÃŸersich des endlichen Geistes, was nur fÃ¼r ihn, ist derjenige Â»Zirkel, den er in das Unendliche erweitern, aus welchem er aber nie herausgehen kannÂ«.

> Ich ist Denken, an sich bestimmend das Objekt; diese Fortbildung ist Denken. Ich, als Subjekt des BewuÃŸtseins, ist Denken; die logische Fortbestimmung des Objekts ist das in Subjekt und Objekt Identische, der wesentliche Zusammenhang dasjenige, nach welchem das Objektive das Seinige des Ich ist. Aber die Fichtesche Wissenschaftslehre faÃŸt den Kampf des Ich mit Objekten als den des Fortbestimmtwerdens der Objekte durch Ich, aber keine IdentitÃ¤t des ruhig sich entwickelnden Begriffs.
Î³) Weil Ich so auf einer Seite fixiert ist, so geht von ihm, als diesem Extrem, aller Fortgang des Inhalts der Wissenschaft aus, und das Deduzieren der Fichteschen Philosophie, das Erkennen, seinem Inhalt und seiner Form nach, ist ein[410] Fortgang von Bestimmtheiten zu anderen, die nicht in die Einheit zurÃ¼ckkehren, oder durch eine Reihe von Endlichkeiten, die das Absolute nicht an ihnen haben. Die absolute Betrachtung fehlt, so wie ein absoluter Inhalt. Z.B. die Betrachtung der Natur ist so eine Betrachtung derselben als reiner Endlichkeiten von einem Anderen aus. So z.B. wird der organische Leib so begriffen: Das BewuÃŸtsein braucht eine ganz eigentÃ¼mliche SphÃ¤re seiner TÃ¤tigkeit. Diese SphÃ¤re ist gesetzt durch eine ursprÃ¼ngliche, notwendige TÃ¤tigkeit des Ich, worin es sich nicht frei weiÃŸ. Es ist ein Anschauen, ein Linienziehen; dadurch wird dies angeschaut als ein im Raum Ausgedehntes. Er ist als ruhend, fortdauernd und doch als unaufhÃ¶rlich sich verÃ¤ndernd oder als Materie gesetzt â€“ diese als eine Menge von Teilen, so hat sie Glieder â€“, da die Person sich nur einen Leib zuschreiben kann, indem sie ihn setzt als stehend unter der Einwirkung einer anderen Person. Aber ebenso notwendig ist, daÃŸ ich diese Einwirkung hemmen kann; und die Ã¤uÃŸere Materie ist ebenso als auch meinen Einwirkungen in sie widerstehend, d.h. als eine haltbare, zÃ¤he Materie gesetzt. Diese zÃ¤hen Materien mÃ¼ssen ferner abgesondert sein, â€“ die verschiedenen Personen kÃ¶nnen nicht als ein Teig aneinanderkleben. Denn mein Leib ist mein Leib, nicht eines anderen; er soll ferner auch wirken, tÃ¤tig sein, ohne daÃŸ Ich durch ihn wirkte. Erst durch Einwirkung eines anderen kann ich selbst tÃ¤tig sein und stelle mich als vernÃ¼nftiges Wesen dar, das von ihm respektiert werden kann; der andere soll mich unmittelbar als vernÃ¼nftiges Wesen behandeln, ich soll fÃ¼r ihn ein vernÃ¼nftiges Wesen sein, ehe ich tÃ¤tig gewesen bin. D.h. meine Gestalt muÃŸ durch ihr bloÃŸes Dasein im Raume wirken, ohne daÃŸ ich tÃ¤tig wÃ¤re; d.h. sie muÃŸ sichtbar sein. Die wechselseitige Einwirkung vernÃ¼nftiger Wesen soll ohne TÃ¤tigkeit aufeinander geschehen; es muÃŸ die subtile Materie[411] gesetzt werden, daÃŸ sie durch die bloÃŸe ruhende Gestalt modifiziert werde. So ist das Licht deduziert und dann ebenso die Luft.
Es ist dies ein bloÃŸes Ã¤uÃŸerliches Fortgehen von einem zum anderen, nach der Weise der gemeinen teleologischen Betrachtung, daÃŸ die Pflanzen und Tiere zur Nahrung des Menschen vorhanden sind. Dies erhÃ¤lt die Wendung: der Mensch muÃŸ essen, also muÃŸ etwas EÃŸbares dasein, â€“ somit sind Pflanzen und Tiere deduziert; die Pflanzen mÃ¼ssen in etwas stehen, â€“ somit ist die Erde deduziert. Es fehlt dabei ganz, daÃŸ der Gegenstand betrachtet wird, was er an ihm selbst ist; er ist schlechthin nur in Beziehung auf ein Anderes betrachtet. Daher kommt der tierische Organismus als eine zÃ¤he, haltbare Materie vor, die artikuliert ist und modifiziert werden kann, Licht als eine subtile Materie der Mitteilung des bloÃŸen Daseins usf., â€“ wie dort Pflanze und Tier nur etwas EÃŸbares sind. Von philosophischer Betrachtung ist dabei keine Rede.

> Eben dies ist der Fall in Ansehung des Inhalts. Fichte hat auch Moral, Naturrecht verfaÃŸt; er behandelt sie aber nur als Wissenschaften des Verstandes. Das Fichtesche Naturrecht stellt z.B. die Organisation des Staats auf. Diese Organisation ist gerade etwas so Geistloses, als diese Deduktion natÃ¼rlicher Dinge und als manche der franzÃ¶sischen Konstitutionen waren, die wir in neueren Zeiten sahen, -eine formale Ã¤uÃŸerliche VerknÃ¼pfung und Beziehung, worin die Einzelnen als solche als absolute gelten oder das Recht das hÃ¶chste Prinzip ist. Das Allgemeine ist nicht der Geist, die Substanz des Ganzen, sondern die Ã¤uÃŸerliche, verstÃ¤ndige, negative Gewalt gegen die Einzelnen. Der Staat ist nicht in seinem Wesen, sondern nur als Rechtszustand begriffen, d.h. eben als eine Ã¤uÃŸerliche Beziehung von Endlichen zu Endlichen. â€“ Die Fichtesche Deduktion der rechtlichen und moralischen Begriffe bleibt gleichfalls in der[412] Schranke des SelbstbewuÃŸtseins und der HÃ¤rte des Verstandes stehen, gegen die Fichtes populÃ¤re Darstellungen von Religion und Sittlichkeit Inkonsequenzen darbieten. Kant hat angefangen, das Recht auf die Freiheit zu grÃ¼nden, auch Fichte macht im Naturrecht die Freiheit zum Prinzip; es ist aber wie bei Rousseau Freiheit in der Form des einzelnen Individuums. Es ist dies ein groÃŸer Anfang; aber um zum Besonderen zu kommen, haben sie Voraussetzungen machen, aufnehmen mÃ¼ssen. Es sind mehrere Einzelne; die ganze AusfÃ¼hrung des Staats hat also zur Hauptbestimmung, daÃŸ die Freiheit der Einzelnen sich durch die allgemeine Freiheit beschrÃ¤nken mÃ¼sse. Sie bleiben immer SprÃ¶des, Negatives gegeneinander. Das GefÃ¤ngnis, die Bande werden immer grÃ¶ÃŸer, statt daÃŸ der Staat als Realisierung der Freiheit gefaÃŸt werde. Es geht mit borniertem Verstande fort, das Naturrecht ist besonders miÃŸraten; er deduziert auch die Natur, soweit er sie braucht, â€“ das ist ideenloses Fortgehen.
