
A [[Grothendieck topos]] or more generally a Grothendieck-Rezk-Lurie [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] is a collection of [[sheaf|sheaves]] or more generally of [[(âˆž,1)-sheaf|(âˆž,1)-sheaves]] on a [[topological space]] or, more generally, on some [[site]]. 

Singling out one of these sheaves as that sheaf which deserves to be regarded as a _sheaf of functions_ on the underlying space is a method of equipping that underlying space with extra structure: for instance for sheaves on a topological space, the chosen sheaf may be smaller than the sheaf of _all_ continuous functions $U \to \mathbb{R}$. For instance if $X$ has the extra structure of a [[manifold]], the chosen sheaf may be the sheaf of all smooth [[function]]s. 

This way singling out a certainm sheaf from all sheaves is a way to encode extra structure. Accordingly such chosen sheafs are called _structure sheaf_ .

A grand formalization of what a structure sheaf is is given by the notion of a structured [[(âˆž,1)-topos]], which subsumes the notion of [[generalized scheme]]:

there, for $T$ an [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] a **structure sheaf** on $T$ is a

* a [[geometry (for structured (âˆž,1)-toposes)]] $G$;

* and an [[(âˆž,1)-functor]] $G \to T$

  * that preserves the singled out morphisms in $G$ (as described at [[structured (âˆž,1)-topos]]).
