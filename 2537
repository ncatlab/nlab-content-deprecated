Israel Gelfand (1913 - 2009) played a preeminent role in Russian mathematics for many years.  His  legendary seminar in Moscow ran for 50 years, and set the pattern for many others, including Sullivanâ€™s seminar at CUNY and Drinfeldâ€™s at Chicago.    His name is attached to many mathematical achievements, including

* the [[Gelfand representation]] of a [[Banach algebra]],

* an important special case, the [[Gelfandâ€“Naimark theorem]] describing commutative [[C*-algebra]]s,

* the [[Gelfandâ€“Naimarkâ€“Segal construction]] describing general C*-algebras,

* the [[Gelfandâ€“Fuks cohomology]] of a [[foliation]],

* the [[Gelfandâ€“Kirillov dimension]] of an [[associative algebra]],

* the [[Bernsteinâ€“Gelfandâ€“Gelfand resolution]] for [[representation]]s of simple [[Lie group]]s.

He helped write a 5-volume work on [[distribution]] theory.
