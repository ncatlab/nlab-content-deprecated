## Idea

A finitely presented [[(âˆž,1)-category]].

If we model [[(âˆž,1)-categories]] by [[quasicategories]], then this can be made precise by saying it is equivalent to the fibrant replacement in the [[Joyal model structure]] of a [[simplicial set]] with finitely many nondegenerate [[simplices]].
