## Definition

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

An [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] $\mathcal{X}$ has **homotopy dimension** $\leq n \in \mathbb{N}$ if every $(n-1)$-[[connected]] object $A$ has a [[global element]], a [[morphism]]  $* \to A$ from the 
[[terminal object in an (âˆž,1)-category|terminal object]] into it.

This appears as [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, def. 7.2.1.1]].


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

An [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] $\mathcal{X}$ is **locally of homotopy dimension** $\leq n \in \mathbb{N}$ if there exists a collection $\{U_i \in \mathcal{X}\}$ of [[object]]s such that 

* the $\{U_i\}$ generate $\mathcal{X}$ under [[(âˆž,1)-colimit]]s;

* each [[over-(âˆž,1)-topos]] $\mathcal{X}/U_i$ has homotopy dimension $\leq n$.

## Properties

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

If an [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] $\mathcal{X}$ is locally of homotopy dimension $\leq n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ then it is a [[hypercomplete (âˆž,1)-topos]].

=--

This appears as [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, cor. 7.2.1.12]].

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

If $\mathcal{X}$ has homotopy dimension $\leq n$ then it also has [[cohomological dimension]] $\leq n$.

The converse holds if $\mathcal{X}$ has finite homotopy dimension an $n \geq 2$.

## Examples

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Up to [[equivalence in an (âˆž,1)-category|equivalence]], the unique [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] of homotopy dimension $\leq -1$ is the the [[terminal category]] $ * \simeq Sh_{(\infty,1)}(\emptyset)$. 

=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, example. 7.2.1.2]].



+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

For $C$ any [[(âˆž,1)-category]] with a [[terminal object in an (âˆž,1)-category|terminal object]], the 
[[(âˆž,1)-presheaf (âˆž,1)-category]] $PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ is an [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] of homotopy dimension $\leq 0$.

In particular [[Top]] $\simeq$ [[âˆžGrpd]] $\simeq PSh_{(\infty,1)}(*)$ has homotopy dimension $\leq 0$.

=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, example. 7.2.1.3]].


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Every [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-presheaves]] is an [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] of local homotopy dimension $\leq 0$.

=--

This appears as [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, example. 7.2.1.9]].

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

If a [[paracompact topological space]] $X$ has [[covering dimension]] $\leq n$, then the [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-sheaves]] $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X) := Sh_{(\infty,11)}(Op(X))$ is an [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] of homotopy dimension $\leq n$.

=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, theorem 7.2.3.6]].


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

For $X \in $ [[âˆžGrpd]] $\simeq$ [[Top]] an object, the [[over-(âˆž,1)-topos]] $\infty Grpd/X$ has homotopy dimension $\leq n$ precisely if $X \in Top$ a [[retract]] in the [[homotopy category of an (âˆž,1)-category|homotopy category]] $Ho(Top)$ of a [[CW-complex]] of [[dimension]] $\leq n$.
