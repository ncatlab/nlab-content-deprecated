## Definition

A [[topological groupoid]] or [[Lie groupoid]] $C$ is called an **Ã©tale groupoid** if the [[domain|source]]-map $s : Mor C \to Obj C$ is a [[local homeomorphism]] or [[local diffeomorphism]], respectively, and hence exhibits the space of morphisms as an [[Ã©tale space]] over the space of objects.

It follows that all the other structure maps ([[codomain|target]], [[identity]], [[composition]]) are also local homeomorphisms, resp. local diffeomorphisms.

This means that we may regard an Ã©tale groupoid as an [[internal groupoid]] in the [[category]] whose objects are [[topological spaces]]/[[smooth manifold]]s and whose [[morphisms]] are local homeomorphisms/diffeomorphisms.

## Properties

### Cohomology and homology

In the literature one finds, roughly speaking, two different approaches to the study of Ã©tale groupoids. One approach is based on the construction of the convolution algebras associated to an Ã©tale groupoid, in the spirit of Connes' [[noncommutative geometry]], and involves the study of [[cyclic homology|cyclic]] and [[Hochschild homology]] and [[Hochschild cohomology|cohomology]] of these algebras. The other approach uses methods of algebraic topology such as the construction of the [[classifying space]] of an
Ã©tale groupoid and its [[abelian sheaf cohomology|(sheaf) cohomology groups]].

## Examples

&Eacute;tale groupoids arise naturally as models for [[leaf spaces]] of [[foliations]], for [[orbifold]]s, and for [[orbit spaces]] of [[discrete group]] [[actions]].


* Every [[topological space]] may be regarded as an Ã©tale groupoid with only identity morphisms.

* For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $\Gamma$ a [[discrete group]] with a continuous [[action]] $X \times \Gamma \to X$ on $X$, the [[action groupoid]] $X//\Gamma$ is Ã©tale.

* The [[Haefliger groupoid]] $\Gamma^q$ has the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^q$ as its space of objects. A [[morphism]] $x \to y$ is a [[germ]] of a [[diffeomorphism]] $(\mathbb{R}^q,x) \to (\mathbb{R}^q, y)$.

  This groupoid, and its [[geometric realization]] play a central role in [[foliation theory]].

* Every [[orbifold]] is an Ã©tale [[Lie groupoid]].
