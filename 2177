## Idea ##

Consider the [[minimal negation operator]] of arity $k$, written in the form $\nu (x_1, \dots, x_k)$ or $\text{â¦—}\: x_1 \text{ï¹} \ldots \text{ï¹} x_k \:\text{â¦˜}$.

Read as a function, $\text{â¦—}\: x_1 \text{ï¹} \ldots \text{ï¹} x_k \:\text{â¦˜}$ returns a value of $1$ in exactly those cases where exactly one of its arguments is $0$.

Read as an assertion, under the interpretation where $1 = \mathop{true}$, $\text{â¦—}\: x_1 \text{ï¹} \ldots \text{ï¹} x_k \:\text{â¦˜}$ makes a statement to the effect that exactly one of its arguments is $\mathop{false}$.

The relation between the function and the assertion is this, that the fiber of $1$ under the function captures precisely the models of the assertion.

This is pretty ugly, but it's the best I have by way of a formal definition at present:

I'll be working to make it more elegantine and less elephantine ...
