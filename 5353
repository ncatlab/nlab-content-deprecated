###### Definition

An **Ã©tale cover** of an algebraic [[scheme]] $X$ is a set 
$\{p_i : U_i \to X\}$ of [[Ã©tale morphism]]s locally of finite type
which are jointly surjective in the sense that $X$ equals the union of
set-theoretic images:

$$
  X = \union_i p_i(U_i).
$$

###### Remark

The condition of being locally of finite type is just strengthening the variant of the  notion of Ã©tale: in the case of non-Noetherian schemes Grothendieck requires instead that Ã©tale morphisms be locally of finite presentation; for the purpose of [[Ã©tale topology]] locally of finite type is required.

###### Remark

The [[Ã©tale site]] has [[covering]]s given by the Ã©tale covers.

###### Proposition

Every Ã©tale cover is a [[cover]] in the [[fpqc topology]].

This appears for instance as ([de Jong, lemma 3.3](#deJong)).
