On a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo]])[[Riemannian manifold]] the _WeitzenbÃ¶ck connection_ is the [[affine connection]] on the [[tangent bundle]] which has vanishing [[curvature]] but possibly non-vanishing [[torsion]].

This is in contrast to the [[Levi-Civita connection]], for which it is the other way around.
