* The following examples are categories of separated presheaves for the $\neg\neg$-topology on various presheaf toposes: 

  * The category of [[monomorphisms]] between sets (as presheaves on the [[interval category]]). {#inj} 

  * The category of sets equipped with a [[relation]] (as presheaves on 
    $$G_1 = (0 \stackrel{\overset{s}{\to}}{\underset{t}{\to}} 1),$$ 
    a truncation of the [[globular category]]). {#endorel} 

  * The category of sets equipped with a reflexive relation (as presheaves on a truncated reflexive globular category). {#endoref}

  * The category of sets equipped with a symmetric relation (as presheaves on the full subcategory of finite sets and injections consisting of just the objects $1$, $2$). {#endosym}

  * The category of sets equipped with a reflexive symmetric relation (as presheaves on the full subcategory of finite sets consisting of just the objects $1$, $2$). See [[category of simple graphs]]. {#endorefsym}

* The category of [[bornological set|bornological sets]]. {#born}

Above don't seem to work as in moving to entry and highlighting it.


How about top-level [$Born$](#born)?
