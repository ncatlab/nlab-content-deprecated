###### Definition


A  **separated** [[(âˆž,1)-presheaf]] over an [[(âˆž,1)-site]] $C$ is a [[(âˆž,1)-presheaf]] $X : C^{op} \to $ [[âˆžGrpd]] such that [[covering]] families $\{U_i \to U\}$ in $C$ the [[descent]] morphism

$$
  X(U) \to PSh_{(\infty,1)}(S(\{U_i\}), X)
$$ 

is a [[full and faithful (âˆž,1)-functor]] and hence exhibits a full 
[[sub-(âˆž,1)-category]].

(Here $S(\{U_i\})$ denotes the [[sieve]] associated to the cover).

More generally, $X$ is **$k$-separated** for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ if the  descent morphism is a $(k-2)$-[[n-truncated|truncated morphism]].

Notice that this means that a _0-separated $(\infty,1)$-presheaf_ is one whose descent morphisms are [[equivalence in an (âˆž,1)-category|equivalences]], hence those which are [[(âˆž,1)-sheaves]].
