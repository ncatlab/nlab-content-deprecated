## Idea



The _Ã©tale (âˆž,1)-site_ is an [[(âˆž,1)-site]] whose [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] encodes the [[derived geometry]] version of the geometry encoded by the [[topos]] over the [[Ã©tale site]].


Its underlying [[(âˆž,1)-category]] is the [[opposite (âˆž,1)-category]] $sCAlg_k^{op}$ of commutative [[simplicial algebras]] over a commutative ring $k$, whose [[covering]] families are essentially those which under [[decategorification]] become coverings in the [[Ã©tale site]] of ordinary $k$-algebras.

## Definition  

Let $k$ be a commutative ring. Let $\infty CAlg_k := (sCAlg_k)^\circ$ be the [[(âˆž,1)-category]] [[presentable (âˆž,1)-category|presented]] by the [[model structure on simplicial T-algebras|model structure on simplicial commutative associativ k-algebras]].

Recall from the discussion there the [[homotopy group]] functor

$$
  \pi_* : sCAlg_k \to CAlg_k
  \,.
$$

For $X \in \infty CAlg_k^{op}$ we write $\mathcal{O}(X)$ for the corresponding object in $\infty CAlg_k$.

###### Definition

A morphism $Spec A  \to Spec B$ in $sCAlg_k^{op}$ is an [[Ã©tale morphism]] if

1. The underlying morphism $Spec \pi_0(A) \to Spec \pi_0(B)$ is an [[Ã©tale morphism]] of [[scheme]]s;

1. for each $i \in \mathbb{N}$ the canonical morphism

   $$
     \pi_i(A) \otimes_{\pi_0(A)} \pi_0(B) \to \pi_i(B)
   $$

   is an [[isomorphism]].

###### Definition

The **Ã©tale $(\infty,1)$-site** is the [[(âˆž,1)-site]] whose underlying $(\infty,1)$-category is the [[opposite (âˆž,1)-category]] $\infty CAlg_k$ and whose [[covering]] famlies $\{Spec A_i \to Spec B\}$ are those collections of morphisms such that

1. every $Spec A_i \to Spec B$ is an Ã©tale morphism

2. the underlying decategorified family $\{Spec \pi_0(A_i) \to Spec \pi_0(B)\}$ is a covering family in the 1-[[Ã©tale site]].
