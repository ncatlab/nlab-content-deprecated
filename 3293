## Idea

In analogy to how a [[Diff|smooth manifold]] is a [[manifold]] modeled on a space $\mathbb{R}^n$ in [[CartSp]], a _FrÃ©chet manifold_ is a [[manifold]] modeled on a [[FrÃ©chet space]].



## Examples

Standard examples of Frechet manifolds are smooth mapping spaces such as the

* [[smooth loop space]].
