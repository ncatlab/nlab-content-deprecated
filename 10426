## Idea

As the [[type theory]] of [[sheaf toposes]] (under the [[relation between category theory and type theory]]) is _[[geometric type theory]]_, so the [[homotopy type theory]] of [[(âˆž,1)-sheaf]] [[(âˆž,1)-toposes]] maybe deserves to be called _geometric homotopy type theory_. 

Traditionally the [[types]] in geometric homotopy type theory, hence the _geometric homotopy types_, are known as _[[âˆž-stacks]]_ and maybe better as _[[(âˆž,1)-sheaves]]_, notably as _[[moduli âˆž-stacks]]_.
