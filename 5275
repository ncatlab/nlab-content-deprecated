###### Definition

A [[symmetric monoidal (âˆž,1)-category]] $(C,\otimes)$ is **closed** if for each [[object]] $X \in C$ the [[(âˆž,1)-functor]]

$$
  X \otimes (-) : C \to C
$$

given by forming the [[tensor product]] with $C$ has a [[right adjoint|right]] [[adjoint (âˆž,1)-functor]]

$$
  (X \otimes(-)\dashv [X,-] ) : C \stackrel{\overset{X \otimes (-)}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{[X,-]}{\to}} C
  \,.
$$

(In cases where the monoidal structure is not assumed symmetric, the property of possessing a right adjoint to tensoring on the left (resp. right) is called *left* (resp. *right*) *closed*, while *closed* is used for the properties jointly (Def. Definition 4.1.1.17 of [[Higher Algebra]]).)

## Examples

Every [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] with its structure of a [[cartesian monoidal (âˆž,1)-category]] is closed. See there for details.
