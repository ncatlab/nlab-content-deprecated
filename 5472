## Idea

An [[(âˆž,1)-site]] is **locally $\infty$-connected** if it has properties that ensure that  the [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-sheaves]] over it is a [[locally âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]]


## Definition

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

Call an [[(âˆž,1)-site]] $C$ **locally contractible** if every constant [[(âˆž,1)-presheaf]] on it is an [[(âˆž,1)-sheaf]].

## Properties

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Proposition

By the general notion of [[(âˆž,1)-colimit]] the constant $(\infty,1)$-presheaf functor has a left [[adjoint (âˆž,1)-functor]] given by taking colimits

$$
  PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C)
    \stackrel{\overset{\lim_\to}{\to}}{\underset{Const}{\leftarrow}}}
  \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$

Since the [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-sheaves]] sits by a [[full and faithful (âˆž,1)-functor]] inside presheaves and by assumption that every constant $(\infty,1)$-presheaf is an $(\infty,1)$-sheaf, this implies that we have also [[natural transformation|natural]] [[equivalence in an (âˆž,1)-category|equivalences]]

$$
  Sh(X, Const S) \simeq PSh(C, Const S) \simeq \infty Grpd(\lim_\to C , S)
  \,.
$$
