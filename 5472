## Idea

An [[(âˆž,1)-site]] is **locally $\infty$-connected** if it has properties that ensure that  the [[hypercompletion]] of the [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-sheaves]] over it is a [[locally âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]]


## Definition

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

Call an [[(âˆž,1)-site]] $C$ **locally contractible** if every constant [[(âˆž,1)-presheaf]] on it is an [[(âˆž,1)-sheaf]] in the [[hypercomplete (âˆž,1)-topos]] over $C$.

=--

## Properties

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Proposition

By the general notion of [[(âˆž,1)-colimit]] the constant $(\infty,1)$-presheaf functor has a left [[adjoint (âˆž,1)-functor]] given by taking colimits

$$
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)
    \stackrel{
       \overset{}{\hookrightarrow}
    }
    {
       \underset{L}{\leftarrow}
    }
  PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C)
    \stackrel{
       \overset{\lim_\to}{\to}
    }
    {
       \underset{Const}{\leftarrow}
    }
  \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$

Since the [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-sheaves]] sits by a [[full and faithful (âˆž,1)-functor]] inside presheaves and by assumption that every constant $(\infty,1)$-presheaf is an $(\infty,1)$-sheaf, this implies that we have also [[natural transformation|natural]] [[equivalence in an (âˆž,1)-category|equivalences]]

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     Sh(X, L Const S) 
       &\simeq 
     PSh(C, Const S)
     \\
       & \simeq  
     \infty Grpd(\lim_\to C , S)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

## Examples

###### Proposition

Let $C$ be an 1-[[site]] such that every object $U$ has a [[split hypercover]] $Y \to U$ such that contracting all representables to points yields a weak equivalence. Equivalently, if the [[colimit]] functor $\lim_\to : [C^{op}, sSet] \to sSet$ sends this to a weak equivalence

$$
  \lim_\to Y \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \lim_\to U = *
  \,
$$

Then $C$ is locally $\infty$-connected.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We may [[presentable (âˆž,1)-category|present]] $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ by the projective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] $[C^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$ [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localized]] at the [[Cech nerve]] projections $C(\coprod_i U_i) \to U$ for each [[covering]] family $\{U_i \to U\}$ in $C$.

By the discussion of cofibrant replacement at [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] we have that a [[split hypercover]] $Y \to U$ is a cofibrant [[resolution]] in $[C^{op}, sSet]_{proj, loc}$ of $U$. 

For $S \in sSet$ a [[Kan complex]] let $Const S : C^{op} \to sSet$ the corresponding constant simplicial presheaf. This is fibrant in $[C^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$. Since every split hypercover is cofibrant, it follows that $Const S$ is an $\infty$-sheaf precisely if for all $U \in C$ and some split hypercover $Y \to U$ we have that the morphism on [[derived hom-space]]s

$$
  [C^{op}, sSet](U, Const S) \to [C^{op}, sSet](Y, Const S)
$$

is a weak equivalence (of [[Kan complex]]es, necessatily). But we have 

$$
  [C^{op}, sSet](Y, Const S)
  \simeq
   sSet(\lim_\to Y, S)
$$

and 

$$
  [C^{op}, sSet](U, Const S) \simeq S
  \,,
$$

so that the condition is that 

$$
  S \to sSet(\lim_\to Y, S)
$$

is a weak equivalence. This is the case for all $S$ precisely if $\lim_\to S$ is [[contractible]], which is precisely our assumption on $Y$.

###### Corollary

Let $X$ be a [[locally contractible topological space]]. Then $\hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ is a [[locally âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [[category of open subsets]] $Op(X)$ is not in general a locally $\infty$-connected site according to the above definition. But there is another site of definition for $\hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)$ which is: the full [[subcategory]] $cOp(X) \hookrightarrow Op(X)$  on the [[contractible]] [[open subset]]s.
