An **($\infty$,1)-sheaf** is another term for an [[âˆž-stack]] with values in [[âˆž-groupoid]]s. 

See [[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-sheaves]] for more.

#Remarks#

The practice of writing â€œ$\infty$-sheafâ€ instead of [[âˆž-stack]] is a rather reasonable one, since a [[stack]] is nothing but a _2-sheaf_. This is the practice adopted for instance in

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Higher Topos Theory]]

But there â€œ$\infty$â€ really means $(\infty,1)$.
