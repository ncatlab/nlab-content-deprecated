## Idea

For some algebraic [[site]]/[[(âˆž,1)-site]] such as the [[Ã©tale site]] or the [[Ã©tale (âˆž,1)-site]], write $\mathcal{B}$ for the [[(âˆž,1)-topos of (âˆž,1)-sheaves]] over that site. For $S\in \mathcal{B}$ any object, write $\mathcal{B}_{/S}$ for its [[slice (âˆž,1)-topos]].
 
Here $\mathcal{B}$ contains a canonical [[group object in an (âˆž,1)-category|group object]] $\mathbb{G}_m \in Grp(\mathbf{B})$, the absolute [[multiplicative group]] given as an [[(âˆž,1)-presheaf]] by the assignment which sends any [[commutative ring]]/[[E-âˆž ring]] to its [[group of units]]/[[âˆž-group of units]]

$$
  \mathbb{G}_m \;\colon\; R \mapsto R^\times
  \,.
$$

The [[inverse image]] of $\mathbb{G}_m$ under [[base change]] along $S \to \ast$ we will still denote by $\mathbb{G}_m \in Grp(\mathcal{B}_{/S})$.

Write $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_m$ for the [[delooping]] of $\mathbb{G}_m$. 

For $X \in \mathcal{B}_{/X}$ any object, then morphisms

$$
  X \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_m
$$

modulate $\mathbb{G}_m$-[[principal âˆž-bundles]] on $X$, whose canonically [[associated âˆž-bundles]] are algebraic $\mathbb{G}_a$-[[âˆž-line bundles]]. (...) (Notice that by the [[Koszul-Malgrange theorem]] these are often better thought of as line bundles with flat holomorphic connection...)

The [[internal hom]]/[[mapping stack]]

$$
  \mathbf{Pic}(X) \coloneqq \underset{X}{\prod} [X,\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_m]
  \in 
  \mathcal{S}
$$

is the _Picard stack_ of $X$.

In good cases its [[truncated object in an (âˆž,1)-topos|0-truncation]] is a [[scheme]], in which case it is called the _[[Picard scheme]]_.
