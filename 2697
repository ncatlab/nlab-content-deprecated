An [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] is **hypercomplete** if the [[Whitehead theorem]] is valid in it.

Hypercomplete [[âˆž-stack]] [[(âˆž,1)-topos]]es are precisely those that are [[presentable (âˆž,1)-category|presented]] by a local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

Every [[âˆž-stack]] [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] has a [[hypercompletion]].
