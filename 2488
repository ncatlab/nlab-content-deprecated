An _$n$-truncated object of an [[âˆž-stack]] [[(âˆž,1)-topos]]_ is the analog of an [[n-groupoid]] or [[homotopy n-type]] in the archetypical [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] [[âˆž-Grpd]]/[[Top]]: 

it is an object $X$ whose [[homotopy group (of an âˆž-stack)|homotopy groups (of an âˆž-stack)]] $\pi_k(X)$ are trivial for $k \gt n$.

###### Definition
**($n$-truncated $\infty$-groupoid)**

An [[âˆž-groupoid]] $A$ is **$n$-truncated** if it is an [[n-groupoid]]:

Precisely: in the model of [[âˆž-groupoid]]-groupoids given by [[Kan complex]]es an [[âˆž-groupoid]] is **$n$-truncated** if, the [[simplicial homotopy group]]s $\pi_k(A,x)$ are trivial for all $x$ and all $k \gt n$.

=--

Let $C$ be an [[(âˆž,1)-category]]. For $X,A$ objects in $C$ write $C(X,A) \in $ [[âˆž Grpd]] for the [[(âˆž,1)-categorical hom-space]] (if $C$ is given as a [[simplicially enriched category]] then this is just the [[SSet]]-[[hom-object]] which is guaranteed to be a [[Kan complex]]).

## in terms of homotopy groups ##

That an object $X$ is $n$-truncated precisely when its [[homotopy group (of an âˆž-stack)|homotopy groups (of an âˆž-stack)]] $\pi_k(X)$ are trivial for $k \gt n$ is the content of [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT prop 6.5.1.7]].


#Terminology#

* A 0-truncated object is also called _discrete_ . Notice that this is _categorically discrete_ as in [[discrete category]], not discrete in the sense of [[topological space]]s. An object in an [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] is discrete in this sense if, regarded as an [[âˆž-groupoid]] with extra structure it has only trivial morphisms.
