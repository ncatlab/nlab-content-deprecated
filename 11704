## Idea

The generalization of the [[Artin representability theorem]] from [[algebraic geometry]] to [[spectral algebraic geometry]].

## Statement

Write $CAlg^{cn}$ for the [[(âˆž,1)-category]] of [[connective]] [[E-âˆž rings]], and [[âˆžGrpd]] for that of [[âˆž-groupoids]].

###### Theorem

Necessary and sufficient conditions for an [[(âˆž,1)-presheaf]] 

$$
  \mathcal{F} \;\colon\; CAlg^{cn}\longrightarrow \infty Grpd
$$

over some $Spec R$, on the [[opposite (âˆž,1)-category]] of [[connective]] [[E-âˆž rings]] to be [[representable functor|represented]] by a  [[spectral Deligne-Mumford stack|spectral Deligne-Mumford n-stack]] locally of almost finite presentation over $R$:

1. For every discrete commutative ring, $\mathcal{F}(A)$ is [[n-truncated object in an (infinity,1)-topos|n-truncated]].

1. $\mathcal{F}$ is an [[âˆž-stack]] for the [[Ã©tale (âˆž,1)-site]].

1. $\mathcal{F}$ is nilcomplete, integrable, and an [[infinitesimally cohesive (âˆž,1)-presheaf on E-âˆž rings]].

1. $\mathcal{F}$ admits a [[connective]] [[cotangent complex]].

1. the natural transformation to $Spec R$ is locally almost of finite presentation.

###### Remark

The condition that $\mathcal{F}$ be [[infinitesimally cohesive (âˆž,1)-presheaf on E-âˆž rings|infinitesimally cohesive]] implies that the [[Lie differentiation]] around any point, given by restriction to [[local Artin rings]] ([[formal duals]] of [[infinitesimally thickened points]]), is a [[formal moduli problem]], hence equivalently an [[L-âˆž algebra]].
