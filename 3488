## Idea

A [[topos]] may be thought of as a generalized [[topological space]]. Accordingly, the notions of 

* [[locally connected space]]

* locally 2-connected space

* etc. ...

* [[locally contractible space]]

have analogs for [[topos]]es, [[(n,1)-toposes]] and [[(âˆž,1)-topos]]es

* [[locally connected topos]]
 
* **locally $n$-connected $(n,1)$-topos**

* **locally $\infty$-connected $(\infty,1)$-topos.

## Definition



+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

A [[(âˆž,1)-sheaf (âˆž,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ is called 
**locally $\infty$-connected** if the (essentially unique) 
[[global section]] [[(âˆž,1)-geometric morphism]] is an [[essential (âˆž,1)-geometric morphism]]

$$
  (\Pi \dashv \Delta \dashv \Gamma) : 
  \mathbf{H}
  \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Delta}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$

If in addition $\Pi$ preserves the [[terminal object]] we say that $\mathbf{H}$ is an **[[âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]]** . 

If $\Pi$ preserves even all [[finite limit|finite]] [[(âˆž,1)-product]]s we say that $\mathbf{H}$ is a [[strongly âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]].

If $\Pi$ preserves even all [[finite limit|finite]] [[(âˆž,1)-limit]]s we say that $\mathbf{H}$ is a [[totally âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]].


=--

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

In a locally $\infty$-connected $\magthbf{H}$ and $X \in \mathbf{H}$ an [[object]], we call $\Pi X \in $ [[âˆžGrpd]] the 
[[fundamental âˆž-groupoid in a locally âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]] of $X$. The ([[categorical homotopy groups in an (âˆž,1)-topos|categorical]]) [[homotopy group]]s of $\Pi(X)$ we call the [[geometric homotopy groups in an (âˆž,1)-topos|geometric homotopy groups]] of $X$

$$
  \pi_\bullet^{geom}(X) := \pi_\bullet(\Pi (X))
  \,.
$$

=--

Similarly we have:

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ an [[(n,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ is called 
**locally $n$-connected** if the (essentially unique) 
[[global section]] geometric morphism is has an extra left adjoint.

=--

For $n = 1$ this reproduces the case of a [[locally connected topos]].


## Examples {#LocallyContractibleExamples}

This proposition gives a large supply of examples.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $C$ be a [[locally âˆž-connected site]]. Then then 
[[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-sheaves]] $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ is a 
locally $\infty$-connected $(\infty,1)$-topos.

=--

See [[locally âˆž-connected site]] for the proof.

+-- {: .un_remarl}
###### Remark

In ([SimpsonTeleman, prop. 2.18](#SimpsonTeleman))
is stated essentially what the above proposition asserts at the level of [[homotopy category|homotopy categories]]: if $C$ has contractible objects, then there exists a [[left adjoint]] $Ho(\Pi):Ho(Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)) \to Ho(\infty Grpd)$. 

=--

This includes the following examples.

+-- {: .un_exampe}
###### Example

For $X$ a [[locally âˆž-connected site]] its [[category of open subsets]] $Op(X)$ is a locally $\infty$-connected site.

The corresponding locally $\infty$-connected $(\infty,1)$-topos $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)$ may be understood as the context of the Artin-Mazur result. See [[geometric homotopy groups in an (âˆž,1)-topos]].

=--

+-- {: .un_exampe}
###### Example

The sites [[CartSp]], [[ThCartSp]] are locally $\infty$-connected. 
The corresponding $(\infty,1)$-topos is [[âˆžLieGrpd]].

## Properties {#LocInfConnProperties}

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

For $\mathbf{H}$ a locally $\infty$-connected $(\infty,1)$-topos, also all its objects $X \in \mathbf{H}$ are locally $\infty$-connected, in that their [[petit topos|petit]] [[over quasi-category|over-(âˆž,1)-toposes]] $\mathbf{H}/X$ are locally $\infty$-connected.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the general facts recalled at [[etale geometric morphism]] we have an [[essential geometric morphism]]

$$
  (\Pi \circ \pi_! \dashv \pi^*\circ L Const \dashv \Gamma \circ \pi_*) : 
  \mathbf{H}_{/X}
   \stackrel{\overset{\pi_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{\pi^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\pi_*}{\to}}}
  \mathbf{H}
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{\L Const}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}}  
   \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$

## Further structures

The fact that the terminal geometric morphism is essential gives rise to various induced structures of interest. For instance it induces a notion of 

* [[Whitehead tower in an (âˆž,1)-topos]].

For a more exhaustive list of extra structures see [[cohesive (âˆž,1)-topos]].
