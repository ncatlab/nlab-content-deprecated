## Idea

A [[topos]] may be thought of as a generalized [[topological space]]. Accordingly, the notions of 

* [[locally connected space]]

* locally 2-connected space

* etc. ...

* [[locally contractible space]]

have analogs for [[topos]]es, [[(n,1)-toposes]] and [[(âˆž,1)-topos]]es

* [[locally connected topos]]
 
* **locally $n$-connected $(n,1)$-topos**

* **locally $\infty$-connected $(\infty,1)$-topos.

## Definition



+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

A [[(âˆž,1)-sheaf (âˆž,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ is called 
**locally $\infty$-connected** if the (essentially unique) 
[[global section]] [[(âˆž,1)-geometric morphism]] is an [[essential (âˆž,1)-geometric morphism]]

$$
  (\Pi \dashv \Delta \dashv \Gamma) : 
  \mathbf{H}
  \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Delta}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$

If in addition $\Pi$ preserves the [[terminal object]] we say that $\mathbf{H}$ is an **[[âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]]** . 

If $\Pi$ preserves even all [[finite limit|finite]] [[(âˆž,1)-product]]s we say that $\mathbf{H}$ is a [[strongly âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]].

If $\Pi$ preserves even all [[finite limit|finite]] [[(âˆž,1)-limit]]s we say that $\mathbf{H}$ is a [[totally âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]].


=--

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

For $\mathbf{H}$ a locally $\infty$-connected $(\infty,1)$-topos and $X \in \mathbf{H}$ an [[object]], we call $\Pi X \in $ [[âˆžGrpd]] the 
[[fundamental âˆž-groupoid in a locally âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]] of $X$. The ([[categorical homotopy groups in an (âˆž,1)-topos|categorical]]) [[homotopy group]]s of $\Pi(X)$ we call the [[geometric homotopy groups in an (âˆž,1)-topos|geometric homotopy groups]] of $X$

$$
  \pi_\bullet^{geom}(X) := \pi_\bullet(\Pi (X))
  \,.
$$

=--

Similarly we have:

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ an [[(n,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ is called 
**locally $n$-connected** if the (essentially unique) 
[[global section]] geometric morphism is has an extra left adjoint.

=--

For $n = 1$ this reproduces the case of a [[locally connected topos]].


## Examples {#LocallyContractibleExamples}


### Over $\infty$-connected sites

The follow proposition gives a large supply of examples.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $C$ be a locally and globally [[âˆž-connected site]]. Then the 
[[(âˆž,1)-category of (âˆž,1)-sheaves]] $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ is a 
locally $\infty$-connected $(\infty,1)$-topos.

=--

See [[âˆž-connected site]] for the proof.

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

In ([SimpsonTeleman, prop. 2.18](#SimpsonTeleman))
is stated essentially what the above proposition asserts at the level of [[homotopy category|homotopy categories]]: if $C$ has contractible objects, then there exists a [[left adjoint]] $Ho(\Pi):Ho(Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)) \to Ho(\infty Grpd)$. 

=--

This includes the following examples.

+-- {: .un_exampe}
###### Example

For $X$ a [[locally âˆž-connected site]] its [[category of open subsets]] $Op(X)$ is a locally $\infty$-connected site.


=--

+-- {: .un_exampe}
###### Example

The sites [[CartSp]], [[ThCartSp]] are locally $\infty$-connected. 
The corresponding $(\infty,1)$-topos is [[âˆžLieGrpd]].

=--

### Locally $\infty$-connected over-$(\infty,1)$-toposes

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

For $\mathbf{H}$ a locally $\infty$-connected $(\infty,1)$-topos, also all its objects $X \in \mathbf{H}$ are locally $\infty$-connected, in that their [[petit topos|petit]] [[over-(âˆž,1)-toposes]] $\mathbf{H}/X$ are locally $\infty$-connected.

The two notions of fundamental $\infty$-groupoids of $X$ induced this way do agree, in that there is a natural equivalence
$$
  \Pi_X(X \in \mathbf{H}/X) \simeq \Pi(X \in \mathbf{H})
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the general facts recalled at [[etale geometric morphism]] we have a composite [[essential geometric morphism]]

$$
  (\Pi_X \dashv \Delta_X \dashv \Gamma_X) : 
  \mathbf{H}_{/X}
   \stackrel{\overset{X_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{X^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\X_*}{\to}}}
  \mathbf{H}
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Delta}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}}  
   \infty Grpd
$$

and $X_!$ is given by sending $(Y \to X) \in \mathbf{H}/X$ to $Y \in \mathbf{H}$.

=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

If in the above $X$ is contractible in that $\Pi X \simeq *$ then $\mathbf{H}/X$ is even an [[âˆž-connected (âˆž,1)-topos]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the discussion there we need to check that $\Pi_X$ preserves the terminal object:

$$
  \Pi_X (X \to X) \simeq \Pi X_! (X \to X) \simeq \Pi X \simeq *
  \,.
$$

=--

## Properties {#LocInfConnProperties}



## Further structures

The fact that the terminal geometric morphism is essential gives rise to various induced structures of interest. For instance it induces a notion of 

* [[Whitehead tower in an (âˆž,1)-topos]].
