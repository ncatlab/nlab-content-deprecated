##Definition

A __properad__ in a [[symmetric monoidal
category]]Â $C$ is a [[monoid]] in the [[monoidal
category]] of bisymmetric sequences inÂ $C$ (i.e.,
functors $\Sigma\times\Sigma\to C$) equipped
with a version of [[substitution product]]
modeled on connected directed graphs with 2 levels
instead of corollas, which are used for [[operads]].
See Â§1.2 in ValletteÂ [1] for details.
The idea is that operations in a properad can
have multiple inputs and outputs, as opposed
to a single output in an operad.
On the other hand, a properad is less general
than a [[prop]], because a prop also
allows nonconnected graphs in the definition
of the substitution product.
